Task 1 was to make an 800 word plan for an application that took into account a data structure, UI and testing strategy.

## <ins>Feedback</ins>

The rubrik was as follows:

| Component | Contribution (%) | My Score | Feedback (+/-) |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Outline of Application | 10% | 6% | - "demonstrated poor knowledge and understanding of the outline of the application" <br> - "failed to provide clear objectives and purposes along with execution plan for the application" <br> - "could of made it very clear about what the application is all about and what are purposes and how to use the application"|
| Designing Data Structure and Algorithms | 60% | 52% | + "brilliant demonstration of the application and understanding to address the learning outcomes assessed by the assignment and/or application to professional practice or real-world applicability" <br> + "there is enough flowchart/diagram throughout to show the data structure is going to to be used in the application to peform insertion, deletion, sorting, searching etc." <br> + "there is evidence of pseudocodes" <br> + "demonstrated a briliiant knowledge and understanding of the data structure |
| Test Plan | 20% | 10% | + "The student has normally talked about that the test is required" <br> - "There is a lack of evidence of appropriate test plan itself" <br> - "There is no real plan" <br> - "There is no clear evidence of the identified checkpoints that the student would like to test and there is no outline of a test plan" <br> - "There is no evidence of actual and expected test results." |
| Academic Intregrity | 10% | 7% | + "It is evident that you have used different sources throughout your report, which shows that the student has clear knowledge and understanding of the citation and references" |

In total, my score was 75%.

## <ins>Reflection</ins>

Overall, I'm happy with the score, I enjoyed the task but I found some of the feedback to be more confusing than explicitly helpful.

This task gave me the oppurtunity to begin to explore digital assistant technology, and consider how a knowledge base might be organised, and uncover some of the layers behind the technology.

Below I've reflected upon the feedback that I received for this assignment.

### <ins>1. Outline of Application</ins>

The 'Outline of Application' makes up a maximum of 10% towards the overall assignment score. I believe that the expectations on this section are out of proportion to the amount of marks it's worth. This claim is based on the following observations:

* In total, a maximum of 90% marks can be gained using the word limit, whilst the other 10% marks are gained outside of the word limit, for integrity in references.
* The assignment had a word limit of 800 words, thus every 100 words should target 11.25% of the possible 90% marks. If an assignment section is capped at 10% marks, then it makes sense to use no more than 88.9 words for it; 1/9th of the total word limit.
* There is no evidence that it is even possible to fit the required content into 90 words to a satisfactory level. The content expected included the objectives of the application, a clear purpose, and an execution plan. But no example was ever provided throughout the module that met the markers expectations. Those examples would have been valuable as both a teaching and learning resource, if they even exist.
* The instructions asked for a "brief outline" without demonstrating brevity for the context.
* The feedback was often non-constructive, so it's unclear what the purpose of the feedback was. Without a purpose for the feedback, beyond gatekeeping a qualification, how can we be sure full marks are obtainable? Or is that the point, as some kind of lesson essential to obtaining the qualification?

On the other hand, my suspicion may be entirely misplaced. There's certainly things that I could have done better, which I've noticed myself. For example; the second paragraph of my assignment provides some vague technological context which wasn't asked for, and thus it could have been excluded and replaced with information that was requested in the assignment instructions.

Additional things I could have mentioned, specifically about objectives, purpose and execution plans include:

* **Objective**: Analysing the state of the users food stock
* **Purpose** Saving users time, money and dignity by minimising waste
* **Execution Plan**: Using requests to prompt responses which may be prepared in advance.

I think it's worth noting that the first paragraph of my assignment (74 words) was specifically dedicated to objectives, purpose and execution of the application already. My paragraph can be summarised as follows:

* **Objective**: Tracking a users food stock
* **Purpose**: Providing utilities that require the state of the food stock
* **Execution Plan**: Using voice commands to a VUI which invokes database operations.

Overall, I definitely found the 'Outline of Application' section quite confusing. The written and verbal instructions were awfully vague, and the feedback was unhelpful too. Constructive criticism should be the standard for the staff at an educational establishment. I definitely would have liked to see a model answer too.

### <ins>2. Designing Data Structures and Algorithms</ins>

All of my feedback was good, so that's nice. I've been given no information on how to improve the 'Designing Data Structures and Algorithms', so I wonder how to improve here. I wonder why I received 52/60 despite only receiving positive feedback. There was no model answer, or comments to build upon, so I have nothing to go by. That's abit confusing. I wasn't completely disappointed by my score in this section, but the grading appears arbitrary.

On a side note, I would never use [Flode](https://docs.codio.com/instructors/setupcourses/resources/resourcetools/flode.html) again. It was quite limited. I also didn't find creating flow charts of algorithms very helpful.

Pseudocode is much easier to work with, and is the standard used in [MIT's 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/) course, and [Cormen et al.'s  Introduction to Algorithms](http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/) textbook, which I believe are trustworthy. Judging by the single lecture provided by UoEO on data structures, and supplementary course material, compared to the quality of materials provided for free by MIT; I can't put my trust in UoEO over MIT.

### <ins>3. Test Plan</ins>

I recognise the 'Test Plan' section to be the biggest area I could have improved on, simply because it wasn't structured as instructions. I mentioned key parts of testing, without forming an actual plan. If there had been a model answer, it would have been clearer what sort of structure the university was looking for.

I think it's worth mentioning too that none of the course material was about creating test plans (or outlining application functions, purposes and execution plans) at this point in the course. I'm not convinced that leaving out fundamental material to our assignments is ethical when there are marks for specifically demonstrating an understanding of the materials. If the assignment is a test of research, then surely the content of the course should include material on research skills, to be tested? It didn't. And the mark scheme already allocates 10% of marks to 'Academic Integrity', a clear indicator of research. The current system avoids scaffolding altogether, which is suprising for an educational establishment. I definately expected some reference by the university to the material that we would be assessed on.

### <ins>4. Academic Integrity</ins>

I received all positive feedback for this section, but I would like to know how the feedback correlates to the mark, as I was given no indicator of how to improve, but I wasn't awarded full marks. I should find out if it's even possible to get full marks, because this blanket of mystery isn't helpful to students looking to improve.
