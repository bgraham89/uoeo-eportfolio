# Readme

Task 1 was to make an 800 word plan for an application that took into account a data structure, UI and testing strategy.

## Feedback

The rubrik was as follows:

| Component | Contribution (%) | My Score | Feedback (+/-) |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Outline of Application | 10% | 6% | - "demonstrated poor knowledge and understanding of the outline of the application" <br> - "failed to provide clear objectives and purposes along with execution plan for the application" <br> - "could of made it very clear about what the application is all about and what are purposes and how to use the application"|
| Designing Data Structure and Algorithms | 60% | 52% | + "brilliant demonstration of the application and understanding to address the learning outcomes assessed by the assignment and/or application to professional practice or real-world applicability" <br> + "there is enough flowchart/diagram throughout to show the data structure is going to to be used in the application to peform insertion, deletion, sorting, searching etc." <br> + "there is evidence of pseudocodes" <br> + "demonstrated a briliiant knowledge and understanding of the data structure |
| Test Plan | 20% | 10% | + "The student has normally talked about that the test is required" <br> - "There is a lack of evidence of appropriate test plan itself" <br> - "There is no real plan" <br> - "There is no clear evidence of the identified checkpoints that the student would like to test and there is no outline of a test plan" <br> - "There is no evidence of actual and expected test results." |
| Academic Intregrity | 10% | 7% | + "It is evident that you have used different sources throughout your report, which shows that the student has clear knowledge and understanding of the citation and references" |

In total, my score was 75%.

## Reflection

Overall, I'm happy with the score, but I found some of the feedback to be more confusing than explicitly helpful.

Below I've reflected upon each component of the assignment.

### <ins>Outline of Application</ins>

The 'Outline of Application' makes up a maximum of 10% towards the overall assignment score. I believe that the expectations on this section are out of proportion to the amount of marks it's worth. This claim is based on the following observations:

* In total, a maximum of 90% marks can be gained using the word limit, whilst the other 10% marks are gained outside of the word limit, for integrity in references.
* The assignment had a word limit of 800 words, thus every 100 words should target 11.25% of the possible 90% marks. If an assignment section is capped at 10% marks, then it makes sense to use no more than 88.9 words for it; 1/9th of the total word limit.
* There is no evidence that it is even possible to fit the required content into 90 words to a satisfactory level. The content expected included the objectives of the application, a clear purpose, and an execution plan. But no example was ever provided throughout the module that met the markers expectations. Those examples would have been valuable as both a teaching and learning resource, if they even exist.
* The instructions asked for a "brief outline" without demonstrating brevity for the context.
* The feedback was often non-constructive, so it's unclear what the purpose of the feedback was. Without a purpose for the feedback, beyond gatekeeping a qualification, how can we be sure full marks are obtainable? Or is that the point, as some kind of lesson essential to obtaining the qualification?

On the other hand, my suspicion may be entirely misplaced. There's certainly things that I could have done better, which I've noticed myself. The second paragraph of my assignment provides some vague technological context which wasn't asked for, and thus it could have been excluded and replaced with information that was requested. 

Additional things I could have mentioned include:

* **Objective**: Analysing the state of the users food stock
* **Purpose** Saving users time, money and dignity by minimising waste
* **Execution Plan**: Using requests to prompt responses which may be prepared in advance.

I think it's worth noting though that the first paragraph of my assignment (74 words) was specifically dedicated to objectives, purpose and execution of the application. I can identify the following:

* **Objective**: Tracking a users food stock
* **Purpose**: Providing utilities that require the state of the food stock
* **Execution Plan**: Using voice commands to a VUI which invokes database operations.

Overall, I definitely found the 'Outline of Application' section more confusing than it needed to be. The written and verbal instructions were awfully vague, and the feedback was unhelpful too. Constructive criticism should be the standard for the staff at an educational establishment. I definitely would have liked to see a model answer too.

### <ins>Designing Data Structures and Algorithms</ins>

As I've been given no information on how to improve the 'Designing Data Structures and Algorithms', I wonder how to improve here. I wonder why I received 52/60 despite only receiving positive feedback. There was no model answer, so I have nothing to go by, which is disappointing. I wasn't disappointed by my score in this section, but the grading appears arbitrary.

On a side note, I would never use [Flode](https://docs.codio.com/instructors/setupcourses/resources/resourcetools/flode.html) again. I didn't find creating flow charts of algorithms helpful in the slightest. Pseudocode is much easier to work with, and is the standard used in [MIT's 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/) course, and [Cormen et al.'s  Introduction to Algorithms](http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/) textbook, which I believe are more trustworthy. Judging by the single lecture we had on data structures, and the provided course material that we received on data structures, compared to the quality of materials provided for free by MIT, I can't put my trust in UoEO over MIT.

### <ins>Test Plan</ins>

I recognise the 'Test Plan' section to be the biggest area I could have improved on, simply because it wasn't structured as instructions. If there had been a model answer, I might have known that sooner. I think it's worth mentioning too that none of the course material was about creating test plans (or outlining application functions, purposes and execution plans) at this point. I'm not convinced that leaving out fundamental material to our assignments is ethical when there are marks for specifically demonstrating an understanding of the materials. If the assignment is a test of research, then surely the content of the course should include material on research skills, to be tested? It didn't. And the mark scheme already allocates 10% of marks to 'Academic Integrity', a clear indicator of research. The current system avoids scaffolding altogether, which is suprising for an educational establishment.

### <ins>Academic Integrity</ins>

Once again, I would like to know how the feedback correlates to the mark, as I was given no indicator of how to improve, but I wasn't awarded full marks. I should find out if it's even possible to get full marks.
