| Structure and Presentation of your findings | 10% | 5% | + "A satisfactory structure and presentation that may follow the set guidelines." <br>  "The quality of work is satisfactory but however, the student could have added more appropriate headings, sub-headings to make the work clearer. For example, i) Description of the context and Rationale, ii) research context, drawbacks and proposed solutions." <br> - "In addition, the whole work could have been justified and a proper cover page and table of contents could have been included" |
| Academic Intregrity | 10% | 5% | + "Overall, satisfactory amount of sources have been used." <br> - "There are rather too many online sources instead of proper academic journals and articles have been used.
