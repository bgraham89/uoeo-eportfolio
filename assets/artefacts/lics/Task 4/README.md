Task 4 was to write a 2000 word argument for the adoption of a chosen technology by a chosen company.

## <ins>Feedback</ins>

The rubrik was as follows:

| Component | Contribution (%) | My Score | Feedback (+/-) |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Knowledge and Understanding of the description of the context of your essay in the form of an overview, i.e. the theme and organisation you have selected, background and the rationale for selection | 10% | 5% | + "The student has demonstrated a very good knowledge and understanding of the context of digital assistant." <br> + "There are some evidences of rationale of selecting the context" <br> - "The student has failed to demonstrate satisfactory background information about chosen organisation." <br> - "The rationale are vague." |
|  Knowledge and Understanding of the Research contents on the technology analysed, its associated problems, and solution proposal | 20% | 10% | + "It is evident that the student has good knowledge and understanding of the research contents as the student has produced enough satisfactory data and information." <br> + "The student has further analysed various issues and challenges of the associated problems." <br> - "the student has heavily relied on Department of Education source and BBC source." <br> - "It has also identified that the student has discussed Conversational Agents, Digital Social Innovation, and Teaching Assistants but not sure which one would be the best proposed solution." |
| Criticality of in-depth review of the proposed solution, use of models for application / enhancement of the technology, i.e. technology adaptation models, and identifying models, and identifying social impacts and threats | 30% | 15% | - "It is evident that the student did try to critique of the proposed solutions and models but however, they are very lightweight critique - in fact the report seems to go off into the realms of an op-ed piece rather than a well-researched, academic report." <br> - "Little use of models to evaluate or critique." <br> -  "there is either very little or no social impacts and threats have been noted." <br> - "the student should have used more actual academic sources to support claims." |
| A scholarly review of the suggested solution (Use of relevant sources) | 20% | 12% | + "a reasonable selection of sources" <br> - "It is noted that the student has more than enough knowledge and understanding of the proposed solutions but somehow the student failed to review them as per the academic contexts." <br> - "too much emphasis on government reports and no references to the (extensive) current research in this area" |
| Structure and Presentation of your findings | 10% | 5% | + "A satisfactory structure and presentation that may follow the set guidelines." <br>  "The quality of work is satisfactory but however, the student could have added more appropriate headings, sub-headings to make the work clearer. For example, i) Description of the context and Rationale, ii) research context, drawbacks and proposed solutions." <br> - "In addition, the whole work could have been justified and a proper cover page and table of contents could have been included" |
| Academic Intregrity | 10% | 5% | + "Overall, satisfactory amount of sources have been used." <br> - "There are rather too many online sources instead of proper academic journals and articles have been used. " <br> - "the student has issues with positioning of in-text citations, which needs careful attention." |

In total, my score was 52%.

## <ins>Reflection</ins>

Overall, I was fairly disappointed with my score, but I enjoyed the task as it gave me a chance to explore current research related to digital assistants. I wasn't too happy with the feedback again, as it was generally dismissive, non-constructive and arbitrary, but with some mental gymnastics, I'm able to move forward with a better understanding of what's expected in the future.

I also think it's worth pointing out that we were asked to submit our chosen technology and company 7 weeks before the assignment deadline, in order to receive approval to write about them. But we received that approval less than 3 weeks before the assignhment deadline, which didn't give us a lot of time to do this assignment. Generally, the quality of guidance and assistance for this first module has been very low, and that has made it even more difficult to produce the flawless work expected of postgraduate students. On the other had, this has given me the oppurtunity to practise patience on some level.

Below I've reflected upon the feedback that I received for this assignment, broken into sections presented by the rubrik.

### <ins>Knowledge and Understanding of the description of the context of your essay in the form of an overview</ins>

I should point out that the title of this section is not clear. The adjectival phrase "of the description" makes no sense here in the context of this assignment. Similar misuse of words has been an ongoing theme in this module.

The biggest take away from this portion of the rubrik for me, is to include a section in my assignment next time that specifically has the purpose to give background information about the organisation. I included background information about the organisation but it was scattered throughout my assignment. There has been a tendency for the marker to subtract marks in all rubrik sections for any structural and referential errors in the assignment, depsite part of the rubrik being dedicated to structure and reference. I think that practise is unethical, but it is the way it is. Therefore, I will put more effort into providing a simpler assigment structure, to overcome that.

In the assignment, I provided the problem specified by the Department of Education itself, and the events leading up to that problem. I'm unsure what other background information is relevant to the assignment. As to the rational of my solution, I disagree that it was vague. I clearly identified some endpoints for the problem that the Department of Education had, to specifically tackle the problem. I then specifically related the benefits of digital assitants to those endpoints. I'm unsure what additional information is required to compose a clear rationale.

### <ins>Knowledge and Understanding of the Research contents on the technology analysed, its associated problems, and solution proposal</ins>

This section's feedback frustrated me. The feedback begins by describing how I've fulfilled this section of the rubrik, but it then ends with a criticism directed towards irrelevant references, and a criticism that I excluded an unobtainable piece of information.

I was told that I relied heavily on Department of Education and BBC sources. I did in fact use multiple governmental sources, but none of them were used as sources for research on digital assistants. I used them for background information about the Department of Education, as I believed those sources to be approriate. I raised this issue with my mentor who told me governmental sources are not even appropiate for background information on the government. That was suprising to me, as the assignment was to address a problem that a company was having, but apparently that problem was supposed to be academically sourced. Nevertheless, this issue should have been addressed in the "Academic Integrity" portion of the rubrik.

The other criticism of sources that I recieved in this portion of the rubrik, claimed that I heavily used BBC sources. To put that in perspective, out of the 50+ inline citations that I used in my assignment, only one was a BBC source, and that was to illustrate the public opinion on education. It was not related to digital assistants whatsoever. I only used academic sources for claims about digital assistants, so I think it's completely unfair to claim that I relied heavily on bad sources for this section. To me, this represents an incompetence in the course provider to provide feedback.

The other major criticism I received for this portion of the rubrik, was the exclusion of a piece of information that wasn't specfied in the assignment instructions. I was told that I hadn't chosen which of 'conversational agents', 'digital social innovation' and 'teaching assistants' was the best solution to the problem of the ineffectiveness of online education. To contextualise this request, I should mention that these were all titles that I used for sections in my assignment for labelling different aspects of digital assitants that were beneficial to schools.

It confused me why I was asked to choose which was the best solution. Essentially, I was expected to compare the effectiveness, of conversational mediums, social pipelining, and computational knowledge engines, in addressing the problem of the ineffectiveness of online education. In other words I needed to ask, what's more important for education during social isolation: conversation, observation or the provision of information? It's an interesting question for sure, but I certainly feel it's well beyond the scope of the 2000 word assignment that I was given.

My actual assignment instructions were to explain why digital assistants would be helpful to the Department of Education. If I have lost 10% of marks for this exclusion, then it should have been mentioned in the instructions to include "the most important aspect of the technology in addressing the problem". I don't personally believe any singular aspect of digital assitants is better than the others, because different students would benefit most from different aspects. If this piece of information is worth 10% of the marks of our assignment, then it follows that it could be answered in ~250 words too, which is 1/8 of the allocated word count, for which 80% of obtainable marks are for content. It seems unreasonable to request a comparison of notable technology aspects, with a conclusion on the best, in 250 words or less.  

### <ins>Criticality of in-depth review of the proposed solution, use of models for application / enhancement of the technology</ins>

For this portion of the rubrik, there's not really anything to say other than some course content on evaluation models would have been useful to give us a stronger foundation for this assignment.

I feel I could have discussed threats to digital assistants more rigourously too.

### <ins>A scholarly review of the suggested solution</ins>

For this portion of the rubrik, I was told that I failed to review my proposed solution, which seems awfully dismissive considering I provided three different types of reviews throughout my assignment. The first review that I provided was a technological review based on a technological adoption model, and the current state of technology available. The second review I provided was a psychological review considering past psychological experiments, contemporary social policy and contemporary pedagogy. The third type of review that I provided was an economic one, based on the costs of software and hardware adoption, and human resource values. I believe I lost marks in this section for structural, and referential problems.

### <ins>Structure and Presentation of your findings</ins>

This portion of the feedback was the most clear, and provided constructive criticism that wasn't misplaced. I agree I could alter the structure of my assignment in the way the feedback describes. I would have done this sooner had I been given a model answer.

### <ins>Academic Intregrity</ins>

I was told that I used too many online sources which was suprising to me in the days of the world wide web. The feedback dismisses my use of academic journals and articles because I included some websites that host examples of digital assistants in the references. I had included them because I felt it was fair. Those sources were not used as a source of academic accounts. I atleast know how to get more marks in this section next time.
