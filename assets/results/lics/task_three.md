# Reflection

Overall, I'm extremely chuffed to have gotten the score I did. I've done challenges like this in the past on sites such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/tag/database/) before. In fact, the LeetCode challenges I'm used to are much more difficult.

As for the feedback, I have no idea what was meant by my solution to Problem 1 being too intricate, which resulted in a -4 % deduction.
I do however believe my solution to Problem 2 might be more complex than necessary, but no alternative solution was provided, which is a shame.
