					<h2><u>Reading</u></h2>
					<p style="color: lavenderblush">
                        The core reading of the week 5 revolved around user experience, while week 6 revolved around software testing. Both sets of reading
						seemed abit random, and not in a good way, when I compared their content to the expectation of content that I had about what should be included 
						in this project management course. Of course that's me being, from my perspective; extremely critical. I've clearly developed my own personal construct
						on what constitues project management, and while I will provide points to back up my perspective; educational psychologists such as <b>Kelly</b> (1955) would
						point out that true learning requires having our views broken. Here's my construct:
					</p>
					<p>
						User experience is an important aspect of sucessful software, and it's something a project manager could focus on. However in my professional experience, working for a large 
						international software development company (<a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/profile?s=LNW:NSQ">Light & Wonder</a>),
						UX is the focus of specialised teams whose job it is to ensure that software meets and surpasses market expectations. They do this by liasing with industry experts and
						enthusiasts. Project managers are not involved in that. Moreover, in businesses with Agile SDLC's, it's the role of architects and developers to build UX as directed by stakeholders. 
						Traditionally, project managers are not involved in the topical discussions. The same holds for software testing too. In relation to a project manager, these processes should be modelled with
						respect to project constraints, fundamentally time, cost and stakeholders. 
					</p>
					<p>	
						That being said, having access to a library of 
						resources means I was still able to develop a more critical perspective on the matter, by evaluating papers with different perspective. One of the additional readings I particular liked was a paper by 
						Shastri et al (2021) titled 
						'<b>The role of the project manager in agile software development projects</b>' which shared my sentiment on the role of project managers, building some self-confidence in my ideas, and critical reference. 
						As a researcher, I do think it's valuable making ideas explicit because reflection in the context of differing perspectives yields new insights. For me that insight consisted of becoming aware of the possibility
						of modelling solutions to the problem of choosing which testing project strategy to use, as an optimisation problem.
                    </p>
					<h2><u>Class Discussion</u></h2>
					<p style="color: lavenderblush">
                        For a class discussion, we were tasked with reading Minge & Thuring's (2018) paper titled '
						Hedonic and pragmatic halo effects at early stages of User Experience',
						available <a href="https://doi-org.uniessexlib.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2017.07.007" target ="_blank">here</a>. We were then asked to
						talk about whether we would change figure 1.

					<h2><u>Group Project</u></h2>
					<p>
						In week 5, we met as usual, this time making use an AI feature built into Zoom, the video 
						conferencing software. The AI summarised our discussion at the end of the meeting. I found this extremely convenient, and was suprised at the depth of the summary.
						Here's that 
						<a href="../../assets/artefacts/sepm/documents/Meeting Summary for oct 23.docx" target="_blank"><b>AI Summary</b></a>. I explored some of the challenges 
						with using AI for summarising meetings.

						In week 6, we submitted the first marked assessmnet, our
