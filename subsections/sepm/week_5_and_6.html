					<h2><u>Reading</u></h2>
					<p style="color: lavenderblush">
                        The core reading of the week 5 revolved around user experience, while week 6 revolved around software testing. Both sets of reading
						seemed abit random when the modules supposed to be about software project management. User experience is an important aspect of 
						sucessful software, and it's something a project manager could focus on. However in my experience working for a large international company
						that cares about user engagement, and therefore user experience (<a href="https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/profile?s=LNW:NSQ">Light & Wonder</a>),
						UX is the focus of user content teams whose job it is to ensure the software meets and surpasses market expectations by liasing with industry experts and
						enthusiasts. Other companies embrace Agile SDLC's where architects and developers build UX as directed by stakeholders. Traditionally, project managers are not
						especially concerned with UX, but as observed in practise, they manage higher-level project aspects such as project sheduling, communication, costs and blockers. 
						I take a similar view on the topic of software testing, which is shaped by architects, and quality assurance teams, and practised by developers.
						The role of the project manager is to deal with development and testing timeframes and blockers, not the specific testing methodology adopted for the project.
						So the reading of these two weeks felt more like filler material than material shared by academic insight.
