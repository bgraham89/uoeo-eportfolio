					<h2><u>Reading</u></h2>
					<p style="color: lavenderblush">
                        A reading that stood out to me this week was 'Ethical Software: Integrating Code of Ethics into Software Development Life Cycle' (Karim et al., 2017)
						because of the responsiliblity of ethics it placed upon project managers, and it's attempt to integrate a code of ethics into a software development lifecycle.
						I liked the piecewise approach of matching ethical statements with specific SDLC phases, and I would be interested in further formalising this integration strategy.
						I found the designation of responsibility interesting too, and wonder what incentives a business might have to conform outside of compliance. I agree we should be ethical,
						and I believe a contemporary goal of ethics should be to provide a means to justify an ethical code is beneficial, so we know we are integrating the correct motives into 
						the development lifecycle. Furthermore, the Agile manifesto has gained popularity by prioritising business-relations and therefore the business, but an ethical code might be more altruistic than
						that and favour non-business relations. The aesthetics might in turn raise business value through external support and shape the business to be good enough, but the higher initial cost to this 
						business strategy reduces the likelihood of this type of business being affordable to set up. Favouring non-business relations from the beginning means less sponsorship opportunities. It's also 
						more difficult to witness the benefits of a specific ethical code without big data. For this reason, I believe it's better for project managers to adopt established codes of ethics under the guise
						of compliance, than to attempt to build one themselves, unless of course it's for reseach.
