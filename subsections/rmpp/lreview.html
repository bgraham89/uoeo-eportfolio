					<h2><u>Methodology</u></h2>
					<h3 style="color: goldenrod"><u>Peer Informed Journals</u></h3>
					<p>
						In order to identify relevant literature that had been thoroughly peer-reviewed, 
						<span style="color:blanchedalmond">
							an initial search was conducted for trusted, journals
							related to 'educational technology'.
						</span>
						<span style="color:blanchedalmond">
							It was necessary for me to select a subset of journals to search within, due to the sheer number of journals related to educational technology.
						</span>
						By chance I came across the research paper:
						<span style="color: aliceblue">
							<a href="https://doi.org/10.14742/ajet.2578" target="_blank">
								Open Access Journals in Educational Technology: Results of a Survey of Experienced Users (Perkins & Lowenthal., 2016)
							</a>
						</span>
						. The paper provides a list of top 25 journals that was gathered from a survey completed by 236 scholars, who had all published in open-access journals related
						to educational technology; and some consideration of journal performance metrics. The credibility of the scholars participating in the journal review, along with the
						credibility of
						<span style="color: aliceblue">
							<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6gt1zrEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra" target="_blank">
								Lowenthal, who has a h-index of 40,
							</a>
						</span>
						provide plausability to the journals being academically credible, so 
						<span style="color:blanchedalmond">
							I've opted to use Perkins & Lowenthal's list of top 25 journals to help filter the literature search.
						</span> It's worth noting that
						no other 'academic journal reviews' were found as alternatives to the Perkins & Lowenthal's, so no comparisons could be conducted. 
						<span style="color:lightgreen">
							I believe the continued academic journal review process is beneficial for the
						systematic development of future literature reviews.
						</span>

					</p>
					<h3 style="color: goldenrod"><u>Top H5-Index Journals</u></h3>
					<p>
						To complement the selection of journals above with journals that have specifically performed well recently, 
						<span style="color:blanchedalmond">
							I will also be including journals that have high h5-indexes,
						</span>
						 indicating that
						in the last 5 years, they have published high impact articles.  
						<span style="color: aliceblue">
							<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_educationaltechnology" target="_blank">
								A list of 20 journals with high h5-indexes is provided by Google Scholar.
							</a>
						</span>
						The credibility of the list is consequential to the traceability of list items, the computational resources available for the algorithmic generation of the list,
						and the credibility of the tool as an academic search engine.
					</p>
					<h3 style="color: goldenrod"><u>Information Management System</u></h3>
					<p>
						In order to store the results of the literature search, and facilitate future access to the literature 
						to be reviewed, I opted to use the productivity software
						<a href="https://www.notion.so/product" target="_blank">
							Notion
						</a> 
						. A link to the workspace can be found
