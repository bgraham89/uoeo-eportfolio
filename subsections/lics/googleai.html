					<p>
						Since 2015, Google has been a subsidary of the company <a href="https://abc.xyz/"
							target="_blank">Alphabet Inc</a>,
						the eleventh largest company in the world (<a
							ref="https://www.forbes.com/lists/global2000/?sh=dd43c05ac042" target="_blank">Forbes,
							2022</a>),
						and the second largest company in the technology industry. Currently, some subsidaries of
						Alphabet Inc that are specialising in artificial intelligence include:
						<a href="https://www.deepmind.com/" target="_blank">DeepMind</a>,
						<a href="https://ai.google/" target="_blank">Google AI</a> as a subsidary of <a
							href="https://about.google/" target="_blank">Google</a>,
						<a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/" target="_blank">Isomorphic Labs</a>, and
						<a href="https://waymo.com/" target="_blank">Waymo</a>.
						<br><br>
						Deepmind was actually acquired by Google, in 2014
						(<a ref="https://www.deepmind.com/about" target="_blank">DeepMind, 2022</a>), before Google's
						restructuring into the umbrella company, Alphabet Inc.
						There are other deep ties between Google and Alphabet Inc too, so for this page, I will be
						outlining and reviewing tools that are attributed to Alphabet Inc
						as well as those of Google.
					</p>

					<h2>DeepMind's AlphaFold</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphafold"
							target="_blank">AlphaFold</a> is an AI system used to predict the shape of proteins,
						from their amino acid sequence. There are over 200 million known proteins, but only a fraction
						of them have had their shape experimentally determined. Part of the
						importance of understanding protein folding, is due to the shape of proteins being a factor in
						the design of contemporary medicine
						(<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/30/1012712/deepmind-protein-folding-ai-solved-biology-science-drugs-disease/"
							target="_blank">MIT, 2020</a>).
						<br><br>
						While AlphaFold itself isn't open to the public as a tool, the predictions it makes are
						available to researchers here:
						<a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank">AlphaFold Protein Structure Database</a>.
						The scientific achievement of AlphaFold can't really be overstated as it currently outperforms
						any other protein folding predictive system in accuracy.
						(<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/30/1012712/deepmind-protein-folding-ai-solved-biology-science-drugs-disease/"
							target="_blank">MIT, 2020</a>).
						This is arguable one of the greatest achievements of artificial intelligence so far, because of
						our lives dependency on medicine.
					</p>

					<h2>DeepMind's AlphaGo</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago"
							target="_blank">AlphaGo</a> is the first AI system that was able to defeat
						a professional human Go player. This is the also the first AI system that caught my attention in
						2015, and inspired me to begin learning
						<a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>. Unfortunately, AlphaGo can not be
						played against by the public, so I've never had a chance of playing it.
						That's slightly disappointing in my opinion. Beyond entertainment, AlphaGo's value is less
						clear. Even the most recent version,
						<a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules"
							target="_blank">MuZero</a>, only plays games.
						A trend of gameifying real world systems may upgrade MuZero's applicability, but MuZero today
						lacks constraints that ensure the games
						that it plays are ethically acceptable.
					</p>

					<h2>Google Assistant</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://assistant.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Assistant</a> is a virtual
						assistant software that comes prepackaged on Android phones.
						Even though I have an android phone, I rarely use Google Assistant because it doesn't really
						provide anything more than a speech-based interface to me. For a phone with a screen,
						it's easier for me to point and touch the apps that I want to use, using the visual cues I'm
						given; instead of trying to remember how something needs to be said to Google Assistant
						in order to get it to perform as I would have liked. Google Assistant is challenged by context
						analysis and incomplete commands, but more so by limitations of preprogramming responses.
						<br><br>
						I think one of the ways that Google Assistant could be improved is by allowing the programming
						and installation of new keyword commands for it by indie developers.
						I might also have found Google Assistant more useful, if I actually owned anything else that
						could connect to it.
					</p>

					<h2>Google Cloud's AI and Machine Learning Products</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a> offers a range of
						<a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/ai" target="_blank">AI and Machine Learning
							Products</a>, focusing on data scientists and developers.
						Some of the products it provides are:
					<ul>
						<li>Machine learning operation guides and tools</lil>
						<li>Optimised infrastructure for machine learning including environments, processing units and
							expert support</li>
						<li>Natural language processing services</li>
						<li>Image and video processing services</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h2>Google Translate</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://translate.google.co.uk/" target="_blank">Google Translate</a> is a tool that
						I've had first hand experience with, I was an english language
						teacher to students who were not native english speakers. Every now and then I would receive
						some homework off a student, that had unusually technical vocabulary,
						an overly formal tone, and the odd misplaced punctuation artefact or mispelt foreign word,
						typically and suspicially typed instead of handwritten.
						These were the times that I had noticed Google Translate had been used.
						<br><br>
						From my own observations, for lower levels of English, upto around B2 <a
							href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions"
							target="_blank">CEFR</a>
						level, Google Translate is superb. Once figurative, cohesive and technical language are
						introduced to Google Translate though, it does a less adequate job.
						I still find alot of value in Google Translate though, especially for navigating foreign web
						pages.
					</p>

					<h2>Isomorphic Lab's Digital Biology</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/newsroom" target="_blank">Digital Biology</a> is a field
						that has emerged as a result of the success of
						<a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphafold"
							target="_blank">DeepMind's AlphaFold</a>, with the aim of accelerating
						drug discovery using AI. There's not much information available about the methodology of digital
						biology that makes it distinct to computational biology,
						other than an association: AI is to biology, what maths is to physics.
					</p>

					<h2>Quick, Draw!</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank">Quick, Draw!</a> is an experimental
						game in which players are told to draw something,
						and an AI guesses what it is. The drawings then provide further data upon which AI can be
						trained. I used Quick, Draw! as a recreational activity while
						teaching english language to students who were not native english speakers. My students found it
						a really fun way to practise their vocabulary. I especially liked
						the fact that learning was happening in both my students and the AI. This game is a genuine
						inspiration to me, and I would like to extend this type of educational
						technology, and create an "I-Spy" derivative.
					</p>

					<h2>Tensorflow</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> is a programming library
						for machine-learning. It provides low-level classes and functions
						for building state of the art deep learning models. TensorFlow is also used as a backend for
						simpler libraries such as
						<a href="https://keras.io/" target="_blank">Keras</a> which has a a simpler API at the cost of
						less customisation.
					</p>

					<h2>Waymo</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://waymo.com/" target="_blank">Waymo</a> is a self driving car.
					</p>


					<h2>Youtube's Automatic Captioning</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube</a> is a subsidary of Google, with an
						<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">automatic
							captioning</a> feature for videos hosted on it.
						The captions are generated using natural language processing models. This feature saves a lot of
						time for Youtube content creators.
