						<h1>Security Metrics</h1>

                    <p style="color:blanchedalmond">
                        This section is dedicated to material related to security
                        metrics, for the relevance they have to a goal-oriented enterprise.

					<h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
					<p style="color: blanchedalmond">
						In the previous module on object-oriented programming, I discovered a 
						textbook by Fenton and Biemann 
						on software metrics, that was pivotal by shifting my perspective 
						of software metrics from a complete skepticism of them, to an appreciation of
						the value they provide to a project manager. I still am very critical against
						metrics that require human opinion or are treated as contextually immune, but
						making software metrics explicit, as instruments of decision making, provides
						more traction for coordination amongst a team. Therefore I made sure to explore
						security metrics in this module.

						I've left out the specific details constituting each individual submetric of the CVSS, as they are well documented in
						the <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/" target="_blank">CVSS specification</a>. CVSS requires alot of
						information to be gathered about a vulnerability, which is both it's weakness and strength.

						<b style="color: blanchedalmond">Is Cyclomatic Complexity relevant in security research today?</b>: 
						Unquestionably, cyclomatic complexity provides a lower bound to the amount of tests that would be required 
						to classify a programme as reliable, by virtue of branch coverage. Cyclomatic complexity might not give 
						the exact amount of tests that would be required,
						but a lower bound is still extremely useful for estimation purposes. If there are less tests 
						written for a programme than the
						cyclomatic complexity of a programme, than it is definitely not fully tested. Therefore there might be
						a security vulnerability. The simplicty of calculating cyclomatic complexity, and comparing it to the number
						of written tests, provides a cheap way to identify if there is an obvious lack of reliability in the 
						programme, and a potential security vulnerability. I don't think there's any reason to not do that check.
