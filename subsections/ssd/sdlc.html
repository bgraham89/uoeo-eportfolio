					<h4><u>Reflection</u></h2>
						<p style="color: blanchedalmond">
							In the last module we were introduced to SDLC's. Prior to that module,
							I was aware of some of the buzzwords connected to development such as
							DevOps and Agile from my own professional experience, but the 
							meaning of them was fuzzy to me, and the distinction between them was blurry.
							Now though, I have a clearer understanding of the difference between an SDLC, and
							DevOps. Both aspects of development are valuable for the management of
							software quality.
						</p>
						<p style="color: blanchedalmond">
							While this page is mainly dedicated to SDLC's, I want to point out that
							well-designed automation minimises human error, so in the future I would
							like to explore DevSecOps more in-depth. That being said, it's important
							to be familiar with how to integrate security practices into an SDLC 
							anyway whether those practises are automatable or not, as security efforts are 
							often a legal requirement in software development.

					<h2><u>Examples of SDLCs</u></h3>

							- Royce builds upon his experience and expresses his advice for managing large software
							systems. He introduces the waterfall model, and emphasises the importance of documentation.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4><u>Review</u></h4>
					<p style="color: lavender"> 
						The non-iterative approach of the waterfall model severly limits security-centred adjustments that
						are found to be needed later in development, therefore I wouldn't recommend it nowadays.

							- Boehm presents the spiral model of software development, adapting the
							waterfall model to be iterative and risk driven.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4><u>Review</u></h4>
					<p style="color: lavender"> 
						The repetition of risk analysis stages in the spiral model gives every opportunity to develop as 
						secure of software as possible. For that reason,
						I would recommend the spiral model for secure software development.

					<h4><u>Review</u></h4>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						Agile is fantastic on a corporate level as it promotes good customer 
						relations, working 
						products and teambuilding. There are 
						many tools and frameworks associated with it too which are great
						such as the SCRUM framework, and kanban boards. However, Agile is
						fine-tuned to producing the minimum viable product for an organisation,
						including minimal security features. For that reason, Agile only works
						well for secure software development, when legal policies or customer
						demands enforce it. In those cases, I would recommend Agile over the Spiral
						model.

					<h4><u>Reflection</u></h4>
					<p style="color: blanchedalmond">
						Of the different security-centred readings, I found the paper by Sharma and Bawa (2020) to be the most useful, simply
						for introducing me to CLASP, Common Critieria, and Microsoft's SDL. When developing secure software, irrespective of the
						software development lifecycle, it's important to be aware of actual security activities and security standards. A good
						SDLC should be able to accomodate those activities and standards, and Agile is able to do so. In the future I would like
						to explore tools for the elicitation of security requirements from customers, to assist agile developers in fufilling
						international security standards.
					</p>
					<h2><u>Group Project</u></h2>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						In this module we were tasked with creating secure database software as a team of four. 
						In order to achieve this, we followed a variation of Agile, splitting the development of software 
						into weekly sprints. We incorporated security into our SDLC through security planning and testing.
						In order to collaborate effectively, we used the following tools:
