					<h2><u>Peer Discussion</u></h2>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						This was my initial submission to a discussion activity, in which we were asked to discuss
						which
						UML model is most suitable for designing security solutions to a chosen vulnerability:
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						"'Injection' attacks made it onto OWASP's most recent Top10 software vulnerabilities, 
						which were decided by considering how exploitable the vulnerabilities are and how impactful 
						those exploits could be[1]. Being somewhat familiar with SQL, I wanted to discuss SQL 
						injections specifically.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b style="color: lavender">Description of SQL Injections</b>
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						OWASP links each vulnerability to Mitres' Common Weakness Enumeration 
						entry of it, a database which gives the following description of an 
						SQL attack:"[The use of] user-controllable inputs, [so] the generated 
						SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of 
						ordinary user data"[2]. 
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						To understand the potential impact of SQL injections, it's standard to 
						relate them to the CIA triad of ideal information assurances [3]. 
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						1. Confidentiality ~ SQL injections can facilitate the exposure of sensitive data. 
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						2. Integrity ~ SQL injections can facilitate the alteration of data.
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						3. Availability - SQL injections can facilitate the destruction of data.
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						The following flow chart aims to show how malicious SQL injections are performed:
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/ssd/diagrams/sqliPT.png" alt="Sql strategy" style="
					display: block; 
					margin-right: auto;
					padding: 20px;
					width: 30vw;
					min-width: 450px;
					" />
					<p style="color: lavender">
						OWASP provides a theoretical example of an SQL injection[4], for the curious. Do you know of any ways to prevent SQL injections?
					</p>
					<p>
						<b style="color: lavender">Model-based Security</b>
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						Being accustomed to UML, it would be really convenient to be able to model security vulnerabilities using it. 
						By modelling security vulnerabilities, we are more likely to remember to implement security protection in our 
						software when implementing those models. 
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						One way security proactivity is achievable, is by using UML extension entities such as stereotypes and tags. 
						There are multiple variations of how these might be formatted, such as using the Object Constraint Language (OCL)[5], 
						or not [6]. As OCL looks intimidating, I think it's less likely to be adopted by new developers, who are most likely to 
						be unaware of security vulnerabilities, so I definitely favour the friendlier version. 
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						The following activity diagram aims to be an example of a visually informative use of stereotypes and tags to 
						indicate a security vulnerability. The stereotype and tag construction 
						I've used is one that's been recommended [7]. Specifically, in the diagram, the stereotype is '<<SqlInjection>>' 
						and the tags are the things written below it. The dotted lines indicate the activity that's being tagged as having a 
						security vulnerability.
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/ssd/diagrams/security_stereotypes.png" alt="Sql strategy" style="
					display: block;
					border-width: 5px;
					border-style: solid; 
					margin-left: auto;

					padding: 20px;

					min-width: 450px;
					" />
					<br>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						Out of all possible UML diagrams, <b style="color:lavender">I think activity diagrams are the most 
						generally useful diagrams for marking security vulnerabilities</b>. Some of the 
						reasons for that include:
					</p>
					<ul style="color: lavender">
						<li>The granularity of detail can be finetuned to suit either developers or other stakeholders.</li>
						<li>Activity diagrams are behaviour diagrams, so vulnerabilities can be situated within the flow of the software. 
							As a developer, I would find that extra helpful.</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						There's definitely arguments to be made for other diagrams such as class and package diagrams, 
						which catalogue some of the components for developers to make use of, but at this point in time, 
						I would somewhat validate those diagrams by referring to an activity diagram. Do you 
						find activity diagrams useful?
					</p>
					<p>
						<b style="color: lavender">Software Development Lifecycles</b>
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						Lastly, I wanted to bring up the task of integrating model-based security into a software development lifecycle. 
						In a secure scrum framework, would it be beneficial to link s-tags[8] to specific activities on an activity diagram 
						associated with security vulnerabilities, for tracking security developments?
