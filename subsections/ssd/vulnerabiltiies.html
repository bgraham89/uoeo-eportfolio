                        "A security flaw, glitch, or weakness found in software code that could be exploited by an attacker." (

					<h3><u>Peer Discussion</u></h3>
					<p style="color: blanchedalmond">This was my submission to a question and answer activity, in which we were tasked to talk answer three questions:
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						<b style="color: lavender">What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</b>: 
						In order to answer this question, we should first clarify what we mean by secure. I would derive a definition from the
						CIA triad which provides a suitable, explicit teleogy to situate the question; which is around the concepts of confidentiality, integrity and availability
						assurance.
						With this, we can consider how a programming language relates to those assurances. We can note that a programming language might 
						host software that guarantees those assurances through the use of well-crafted protocols. We can also note that if those 
						protocols can be modelled using finite state machines,
						then a turing complete programming language can implement those protocols, and be secure. To create a degree of security, we 
						could consider how easy it is for a developer to implement those secure protocols in the language, using a metric such as number of lines 
						of code it takes to implement them.  
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						<b style="color: lavender">Could Python be classed as a secure language?</b>: 
						Python is turing complete so it is as secure as any other turing complete
						language, at some granularity of detail. The simplicity of the language makes it generally
						easy to programme with, but the assurance of confidentiality, integrity and availability is
						not inherit to the language. For example; private variables can be accessed, immutable data
						can become unaccessible through reassignment, and variables can be altered too through 
						reassignment.
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						<b style="color: lavender">Would python be a better language to create operating languages than C?</b>: 
						As memory management is abstracted away in Python, it would be more difficult to create the kernel
						of an operating system, which requires direct access to memory for low level tasks such as 
						resource allocation.

					<h3><u>Tips for Resilience</u></h3>
					<p style="color: blanchedalmond">This was my submission to a blogging activity, in which we were tasked to talk about
						<b style="color: blanchedalmond">How to overcome insider cyber security threats</b>:
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						"A study by Zimmerman and Renaud (2019) found that people are often seen by government, industry and hackers as security threats. Justification for that view stems from observations such as:
					</p>
					<ul style="color: lavender">
						<li>People don't always follow best security practices.</li>
						<li>People unknowingly create software vulnerabilities.</li>
						<li>People can be malicious.</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						So, how can we overcome cybersecurity threats from the inside?
					</p>
					<h4 style="color: lavender">Follow the Best Security Practices</h4>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						It's important to establish what the best security practices 
						actually are. Risk communication and consultation is a continual 
						and iterative process to provide, share and obtain information 
						(ISO, 2018). Promote a culture of learning and sharing of 
						expertise to ensure everybody is aware of the best practises. 
						Cybersecurity is dynamic, so requires active learning to keep up. 
						Being a part of an information sharing community is beneficial 
						for that reason too (Skopik et al, 2016).
					</p>
					<h4 style="color: lavender">Reduce Software Vulnerabilities</h4>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						Reducing software vulnerabilities is much easier said than done.
						A balance of resilience against attacks is just as vital as 
						resistance to them (Zimmerman and Renaud, 2019). Software metrics 
						such as the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) attempt 
						to measure security vulnerabilities with regards to impact and 
						likelihood of threats (Fenton & Bieman, 2015), providing some 
						control as to where to build resistance and resilience into 
						your system. But, security metrics such as CVSS do not 
						identify specific software vulnerabilities, because those 
						vulnerabilities stem from code reliability. Software 
						reliability models assume that systems will eventually 
						fail (Fenton & Bieman, 2015). The critical systems of the 
						international space station for example are built with 
						two-failure tolerance, so that if something goes wrong, it's 
						less likely to result in a catastrophic event (NASA, 2007). 
						Boost resistance and resilience.
					</p>
					<h4 style="color: lavender">Don't be Malicious</h4>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						Roberts et al (2018) found that no security solution 
						can totally mitigate the threat of malicious betrayal. 
						Malice is a societal concern, and the law is its 
						deterrent. Facilitating the development of 
						genuinely rewarding incentives on an individual 
						level; to complement the possibility of punishment 
						for wrong doing gives your team more incentive to 
						protect itself. This positive organisational psychology,
						 combined with security resilience, and culture of learning, 
						 I believe, will help you overcome insider cyber security threats.
