							- ATT&CK is a database of knowledge related to the security of enterprises, mobiles and
                            industrial contol systems. It includes knowledge on adversary's tactical goals, 
                            techniques, and ways to mitigate them</a>.

							</b>
							- CWE is a community-developed database of security vulnerabilities, trusted by

					<h3><u>Reflection</u></h3>
						<p style="color: blanchedalmond">
							I really appreciate the work that goes into these databases, particularly the 
							ontological part of the design. Identifying the attributes and relationships
							that exists between concepts, that subsume all current knowledge while making
							it accessible, is fascinating.
							I find the fact that the above databases are valuable to the security community,
							encouraging too, as I try to find the balance between motives of aesthetics and practicality. 
							I would like to 
							contribute to an ontological project, and I've
							now seen how that interest intersects with security to become communally useful. Essentially an ontology is a formal hub
							of knowledge that's made accessible using a well-defined structure. The security-centred databases linked above, share details worth accomodating as 
							a software engineer, for the improvement of software quality and therefore service. As a software engineer myself, 
							I could learn more from these databases to make my software more secure.

					<h2><u>Tips for Resilience</u></h2>
					<p style="color: blanchedalmond">This was my submission to a blogging activity, in which we were tasked to talk about
						<b style="color: blanchedalmond">How to overcome insider cyber security threats</b>:
					</p>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						"A study by Zimmerman and Renaud (2019) found that people are often seen by government, industry and hackers as security threats. Justification for that view stems from observations such as:
					</p>
					<ul style="color: lavender">
						<li>People don't always follow best security practices.</li>
						<li>People unknowingly create software vulnerabilities.</li>
						<li>People can be malicious.</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						So, how can we overcome cybersecurity threats from the inside?
					</p>
					<h4 style="color: lavender">Follow the Best Security Practices</h4>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						It's important to establish what the best security practices 
						actually are. Risk communication and consultation is a continual 
						and iterative process to provide, share and obtain information 
						(ISO, 2018). Promote a culture of learning and sharing of 
						expertise to ensure everybody is aware of the best practises. 
						Cybersecurity is dynamic, so requires active learning to keep up. 
						Being a part of an information sharing community is beneficial 
						for that reason too (Skopik et al, 2016).
					</p>
					<h4 style="color: lavender">Reduce Software Vulnerabilities</h4>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						Reducing software vulnerabilities is much easier said than done.
						A balance of resilience against attacks is just as vital as 
						resistance to them (Zimmerman and Renaud, 2019). Software metrics 
						such as the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) attempt 
						to measure security vulnerabilities with regards to impact and 
						likelihood of threats (Fenton & Bieman, 2015), providing some 
						control as to where to build resistance and resilience into 
						your system. But, security metrics such as CVSS do not 
						identify specific software vulnerabilities, because those 
						vulnerabilities stem from code reliability. Software 
						reliability models assume that systems will eventually 
						fail (Fenton & Bieman, 2015). The critical systems of the 
						international space station for example are built with 
						two-failure tolerance, so that if something goes wrong, it's 
						less likely to result in a catastrophic event (NASA, 2007). 
						Boost resistance and resilience.
					</p>
					<h4 style="color: lavender">Don't be Malicious</h4>
					<p style="color: lavender">
						Roberts et al (2018) found that no security solution 
						can totally mitigate the threat of malicious betrayal. 
						Malice is a societal concern, and the law is its 
						deterrent. Facilitating the development of 
						genuinely rewarding incentives on an individual 
						level; to complement the possibility of punishment 
						for wrong doing gives your team more incentive to 
						protect itself. This positive organisational psychology,
						 combined with security resilience, and culture of learning, 
						 I believe, will help you overcome insider cyber security threats.
