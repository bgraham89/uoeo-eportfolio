                    <p>
                        "Every (human) computation can be done by a Turing Machine" (
                            <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/development_operations" target="_blank">
                                Copeland, 2017

					<h5 style="color: blanchedalmond"><u>Reaction</u></h5>
					<p style="color: blanchedalmond">
						The Church-Turing thesis is a profound one, as it's essentially 
						saying there is a class of computations that a Turing machine can 
						perform, and this class is equivalent to the class of all known
						human calculable functions, making a turing machine a model of the human limits
						when it comes to calculating. Copeland (2017) does well to discuss surrounding philosophy, 
						including misconceptions and influence.
					</p>
					<p style="color: blanchedalmond">
						Below I've pulled out notable concepts related to Turing machines for future reference, including
						adaptations of turing machines that disprove some family theses of the church-turing thesis.  
					</p>   
					<h4 style="color: lightskyblue">Maximality Thesis</h4>
                    <p>
                        "All functions that can be generated by machines (working in accordance with a finite 
						program of instructions) are computable by effective methods" (
                            <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/development_operations" target="_blank">

                    </p>
					<h5 style="color: lightseagreen">Extended Turing Machine (ETM)</h5>
                    <p>
                        "An ETM is exactly like a standard Turing machine except that, whereas a standard Turing machine stores only 
						a single discrete symbol on each (non-blank) square of its tape (e.g., ‘0’ or ‘1’), 
						a single square of an ETM’s tape can store any desired real number" (

                    <p>
                        "Accelerating Turing machines (ATMs) are exactly like standard Turing 
						machines except that their speed of operation accelerates as the 
						computation proceeds" (

                        "Any process that can be given a mathematical description (or that is scientifically describable 
						or scientifically explicable) can be simulated by a Turing machine." (

							- Copeland provides an encyclopedic entry on the Church-Turing thesis, outlining
                            versions of it and misconceptions. Critical attention is also given to the maximality
                            and simulation theses.

					<h2 style="color: blanchedalmond"><u>Reflection</u></h2>
					<p style="color: blanchedalmond">
						Automata are a type of model with a formal underpinning, which obviously makes them useful 
						for modelling and formal analysis. I find them deeply interesting, as someone with a Bachelors
						degree centred on mathematics and psychology, simply for them being artifacts of human thought
						that's able to describe organisation in the universe around us. I was happy to learn of applications 
						such as in the production of evil regex, and the development of security protocols as
						once again, it meant I had a domain-specific excuse to learn more about them. I plan to 
						eventually create a catalogue of models for an encylopedic, passion project. Until then,
						I'll continue to look for oppurtunities to devote a bit of time to more theoretical computer science,
						out of curiosity. Professionally, finite automata are another tool I can incorporate into my work, if
						requested.
