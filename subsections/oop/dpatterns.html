					<p>
						Before starting this module, I struggled to see the value of design patterns.
						Design pattern don't fit any measurable scales as easily as algorithm do, 
						so their benefits of design patterns are not immediately obvious or verifiable.
						I have gained more appreciation for them though. 
					</p>
					<p>	
						I note that the benefits of design patterns are usually discursive and organisational 
						ones, and the theory behind them is usually has additional educational benefits. So I
						definately advocate learning about them, to speed up the acquisition of good 
						decision making. The existence of design patterns is a really good reason to have senior
						engineers working on a project, as they are more likely to have the foresight required
						to grasp the value of them.  
					</p>  
					<p>
						Unfortunately, the problems that design pattens solve are not always problems 
						that traditional design methods uncover, so that can make design patterns
						difficult to plan for early one. Design patterns are also ontologically elusive, so are not 
						always easy to incorporate later on either. For those reasons, I think value could be 
						gained by refactoring design patterns into parts of larger contextual models, simply
						to help with the conceptual acquistion of them. Context models are more tangible.
					</p>
					<p>
						A goal of mine for the future is to learn other ways that the
						space of design patterns can be organised, and test if that improves 
						aquistion.
