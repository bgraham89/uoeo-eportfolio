					<h2><u>Python Implementations</u></h2>
					<p>This section showcases some implementations of design patterns.</p>
					<h3 style="color: palegreen"><u>The Strategy Pattern</u></h3>
					<p>
						The strategy pattern is a behavioural design pattern that encapsulates the
						selection of an algorithm for a task during a programme. For my implementation of a strategy class for sorting, see
						<a href="https://github.com/bgraham89/uoeo-eportfolio/tree/main/assets/artefacts/oop/notebooks/" target="_blank"><b style="color: palegreen">here</b></a>.
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/oop/notebooks/screenshots/strategy.png" alt="sort strategy"/>
					<br>
					<h3 style="color: palegreen"><u>The Decorator Pattern</u></h3>
					<p>
						The decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows the
						dynamic addition of behaviour to an object. Python features a decorator syntax which can be used to wrap functions aswell as objects.
						For that reason, Python decorators might be disregarded as implementations of the decorator pattern. 
						However, in Python, functions themselves are objects, so it's debatable whether all Python decorators are implementations
						of the decorator pattern. On some level, a Python decorator on a function, is a callable decorator object wrapping
						a callable object. In the spirit of both Python, and OOP, you can see my implementation of a decorator class for repeating a function
						<a href="https://github.com/bgraham89/uoeo-eportfolio/tree/main/assets/artefacts/oop/notebooks/" target="_blank"><b style="color: palegreen">here</b></a>.
						If this was truly Pythonic, the decorator would be defined using function syntax. Similarly, if this was truly OOP, the decorator would
						be wrapping a class defintion. I think this code snippet illustrates a disparity between design and implementation principles, in this case
						OOD and Python syntax. A software engineer needs to aware of the virtues and costs of competing principles, and choose between them,
						while an academic should aim to make a reasonable choice possible. 
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/oop/notebooks/screenshots/decorator.png" alt="decorator"/>
					<br>
					<h3 style="color: palegreen"><u>The Factory Pattern</u></h3>
					<p>
						The factory pattern is a creational design pattern that allows the
						creation of objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. This could be to handle
						temporary components that replace each other for example. In python specifically, factories gain the additional
						use case of enabling paramaters to be passed to decorators. For my implementation of that idea, see 
						<a href="https://github.com/bgraham89/uoeo-eportfolio/tree/main/assets/artefacts/oop/notebooks/" target="_blank"><b style="color: palegreen">here</b></a>.
						To me, this example illustrates how design patterns are more than just implementations. The decision to use paramaterised
						decorators needs to be made in relation to tangible virtues and costs. I found during my implementation of an autonomous car system,
						part of this modules' coursework, that using mixin functions within methods was better than using paramaterised decorators to wrap the methods.
						This was becuase I could pass an instantiated objects' state to a mixin, as the state is available from within a method, but I couldn't pass 
						the objects' state to a paramaterised decorator wrapping a method, as the decorator is called before the method is. Language experience is 
						needed to verify the applicability of design patterns to language specific use cases.

					<h2><u>Design Pattern Recommendation Systems</u></h3>
					<p>This section showcases some methods for generating design pattern recommendation systems.</p>
					<h3 style="color: palegoldenrod"><u>Classifiers</u></h3>
					<p>
						A classifier is a model that can be trained to make a prediction as to
						what category some specific data belongs to. For example, a classifier can try
						to match natual language inputs, to a design pattern. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Classifiers are supervised machine learning models, that need to be
						trained on a set of input-output pairs. The algorithms that classifiers use vary
						but some of the most common examples include: 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Naive Bayesian Classifier</b> which is based on Bayesian probability theory. </li>
						<li><b>Support Vector Classifier</b> which is based on using hyperplanes to seperate input space.</li>
						<li><b>Decision Tree Classifier</b> which is based on using comparisons to seperate input space.</li>
						<li><b>K Nearest Neighbours Classifier</b> which is based on similarity between inputs.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						For my implementation of a classifer in Python see  
						<a href="https://github.com/bgraham89/uoeo-eportfolio/tree/main/assets/artefacts/oop/notebooks/" target="_blank"><b style="color: palegoldenrod">here</b></a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use classifiers with natural language, one technique is to convert text expressions
						into a long vectors matching the length of an entire lexicon. Then each expression 
						can be one hot encoded into the same shape, for consistency. This is called a bag of words model.
						For a design pattern recommendation system, a classifier can be trained to map vectors
						to integers which represent design patterns. This would require a lot of preprocessed training
						data, and processing power, but Software as a Service (SaaS) providers offer tools that make
						building classifiers more feasible.   
					</p>
					<br>

					<h3 style="color: paleturquoise"><u>Large Language Models</u></h3>
					<p>
						A Large Language Model (LLM) is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that has been trained 
						on large amounts of text, to be able to perform an array of langauge tasks. Out of interest,
						I asked <a href= "https://openai.com/product/gpt-4" target="_blank"><b>Chat GPT-4</b></a>, a trending LLM,
						to recommend design patterns for some of the scenarios that Gamma et al (1995) use to present 
						the applicability of design patterns. The results are
						<a href="https://github.com/bgraham89/uoeo-eportfolio/tree/main/assets/artefacts/oop/ai/" target="_blank"><b style="color: paleturquoise">here</b></a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite the results, LLM's are not generally reliable sources of information, as they tend to hallucinate
						information, and they don't always have access to external sources (Peng et al., 2023). Efforts
						to increase their reliablility include:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Giving LLM's the capability to search the internet. 
							(<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/bing?form=MA13FJ" target="_blank"><b>Microsoft Bing, 2023</b></a>).
						</li>
						<li>Giving LLM's the capability to use computational knowledge engines.
							(<a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/03/chatgpt-gets-its-wolfram-superpowers/" target="_blank"><b>Wolfram Alpha's Plugin, 2023</b></a>).
						</li>
						<li>Giving LLM's the capability to generate executable code. 
							(<a href="https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-x" target="_blank"><b>Github Copilot X, 2023</b></a>).
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2 style="color: lightcoral"><u>End of Module Reflection</u></h2>
					<p>
						Before starting this module, I struggled to see the value of design patterns.
						Design pattern don't fit any measurable scales as easily as algorithms do, 
						so their benefits of design patterns are not immediately obvious or verifiable.
						I have gained more appreciation for them though. 
					</p>
					<p>	
						I note that the benefits of design patterns are usually discursive and organisational 
						ones, and the theory behind them usually has additional educational benefits. So I
						definitely advocate learning about them, to speed up the acquisition of good 
						decision making. The existence of design patterns is a really good reason to have senior
						engineers working on a project, as they are more likely to have the foresight to
						recommend them.  
					</p>  
					<p>
						Unfortunately, the problems that design pattens solve are not always problems 
						that traditional design methods uncover, so that can make design patterns
						difficult to plan for early on. Design patterns are also ontologically elusive, so are not 
						always easy to incorporate later on either. For those reasons, I think value could be 
						gained by refactoring design patterns into parts of larger contextual models, simply
						to help with the conceptual acquistion of them. I find contextual models more tangible.
					</p>
					<p>
						A goal of mine for the future is to learn other ways that the
						space of design patterns can be organised, and test whether different models of
						design pattern space improve the aquistion of the wisdom inherent to them. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, I would like to say that I have previous experience building machine learning 
						models, so I took the opportunity to showcase some of that experience in the context of
						design pattern recommendation systems. I feel that's the best way for me to contribute
						to the topic of design patterns, and challenge the value of experience in their
						justification. Large language models for instance can read larger amounts of discourse
						than humans can. I'm keen to learn about post-AI epistemological models,
						along with alternative design pattern models.
