						<h1>Software Metrics</h1>
					</header>
					<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="#" alt="" /></span> -->
					<p>This is a collection software metrics, categorised by concern, as a means to organise:</p>
					<h2><u>Life Cycle</u></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The software development life cycle of a project is a central concern to a project manager.
						</li>
						<li>
							Metrics describing software development life cycles are either retrospective or predictive. 
							Retrospective metrics are essential to project evaluation, while predictive metrics can influence 
							process and content decisions. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Fenton, N & Bieman, J. (2015) <i>Software metrics: a rigorous and practical approach</i>. 3rd ed.
							Boca Raton: CRC Press. ISBN 9780367659028</b> - A textbook that outlines a goal-based project framework
							which is a framework that relies on software metrics. The textbook includes theory on measurment in general, 
							types of metrics such as process, product and resource metrics; data collection
							and investigation techniques, data analysis techniques, prediction models and validation techniques. 
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2><u>Polymorphism</u></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Polymorphism is the provision of a common interface to different objects and allows the 
							same procedure to be used for different objects. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Polymorphism can be achieved through inheritence in all object-oriented languages, and
							through duck typing in some languages.
						</li>
						<li>
							Metrics that measure polymorphism in a programme can indicate whether it's trivial to retroactively 
							add static type checkers to programmes written in dynamic languages or not. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Åkerblom, B & Wrigstad, T. (2015)
							'Measuring polymorphism in python programs'.
							<i>Proceedings of the 11th Symposium on Dynamic Languages (DLS 2015)</i>. 
							Pittsburgh, USA, 2015. New York: Association for Computing Machinery. 114–128.
							<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2816707.2816717">DOI.</a></b> - Åkerblom & Wrigstad 
							outline measures of polymorphism such as observing and counting how many types of objects
							call each method in a programme, classifying each method by whether it's callers share a common superclass 
							definition, and classifying whether clusters of methods that share 
							the same caller have been defined in some superclass of the cluster's callers, and if those callers share a 
							common subclass too.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2><u>Reliability</u></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A software development lifecycle usually involves at least one stage specifically geared towards achieving
							the quality and assurance, or reliability of software. Reliability contributes to a software's reusability as a product, 
							and can decrease the software's future maintenence costs.
						</li>
						<li>
							Software testing is one way to increase software reliability. Types of testing include:
							unit testing, integration testing, performance testing and black-box testing. Automatic testing is common too.
							Code linters for example offer a level of automated code testing while it's being written, whilst more advanced automated testing 
							is achievable using software such as <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/" target="_blank">SonarQube</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Test-centred metrics of software include <b>test coverage</b>, which is the percentage of a programme that has been tested, and
							<b>test effectiveness</b>, which is the ratio of software bugs found to number of tests.
						</li>
						<b>Fenton, N & Bieman, J. (2015) 'Software Reliability, Measurement and Prediction', in: Fenton, N & Bieman, J. (2015) 
							<i>Software metrics: a rigorous and  practical approach</i>. 3rd ed. Boca Raton: CRC Press. 475-523. ISBN 9780367659028</b> 
							- A chapter of a textbook that speciifcally talks about reliability theory and software failure prediction models.
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2><u>Reusability</u></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Software reusability can be recognised through the notions of reusable assets, processess, products and services.
						</li>
						<li>
							Component-based software engineering is a discipline that explicitly makes use of resuable assets.
							However, all programming paradigms implicitly depend upon some reusability of entities, so reusability 
							is inheritent to all software engineering too.

								'State-of-the-Art Object-Oriented Metrics and It's Reusability: A Decade Review'.
								<i>Smart Computing and Informatics: Proceedings of the First International
									Conference on SCI 2016, Volume 1</i>. Visakhapatnam, India, 2022.
								Singapore: Springer Singapore. 431-441.</b>
							- Padhy et al. outline 11 reusable assets of object-oriented software. These include:
							data, modules, architecture, algorithms, design patterns, documentation,
							knowledge, models, requirements, services and tests.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Discussion</h3>
					<p>
						As a collaborative activity with my peers, we discussed <b>'which of the 11 assets
							identified by Padhy et al (2017), should be prioritised to maximise the reusablility of
							software?'</b>. Each of us made an initial post to answer that question, and then we
						responded
						to those with our own development questions. The full discussion can be found 
						<a href="../../assets/artefacts/oop/Reusability/Discussion.pdf"
							target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>. The following is summary post that I wrote at the end of the discussion:
					</p>
					<quote>
						"In my initial post, I created a priority list for the 11 reusability properties of
						object-oriented software given by Padhy et al., (2018), prioritised by how they
						affect the reusability of software. I considered three different ways that software
						can be reused; which were 1) through application to a user, 2) through code recycling
						to a software developer, 3) through experience gained during development.
						I prioritised properties that increased the reusability of software as an
						application to a user, and reasoned that the ordering I provided maximised
						the reusability of software, because there are more software users than software
						developers, and developers are more likely to recycle code of applications that
						are frequently reused.
					</quote>
					<quote>
						I learnt from others, many different interpretations of how to prioritise
						properties to increase the reusability of software. I had already suspected
						that a priority list was doomed to what the language philosopher Wittgenstein (1953)
						denotes 'language games'. That's the idea that words obtain meaning from contextual
						rules that speakers perceive to be governed by during the activity that they
						are participating in; so there is no singular correct answer. From reading the
						initial posts of others, I learnt that many people believe that prioritisation
						should take into account project specifications, and not everybody agreed that
						all properties contributed to the reusability of software in a significant way.
					</quote>
					<quote>
						During discussions I asked the following questions:
						<b>Is it possible to of make each type of asset reusable across projects?</b>,
						<b>What specific steps can be taken to make different assets more reusable?</b>,
						<b>Which types of assets are easiest / most difficult to document?</b>, and
						<b>Is it important to document the lesson's learnt from a project?</b>
					</quote>
					<quote>
						I asked questions because I wanted to gain some practical tips, and
						challenge my own and others perspectives, to learn. I learned that some project
						specifications may promote a position of disregard to the reusability of
						some types of assets, perhaps by the project specification being too specific.
						I learned that documentation of experiences gained during a project may have
						some educational value, and I learned that formal documentation is a process that
						exists as part of DevOps for some businesses.
					</quote>
					<quote>
						In my own discussion thread, I asked "<b>How is the reusability of software a useful
							metric?</b>".
						This question ended up being reflected back at me, but that allowed me to reflect on my own
						position.
						I considered reusability as software capability, and then as a motive behind software
						development.
						I considered scenarios where reusability is desirable, and scenarios where it is not,
						centring my arguments on contexts of cooperation and contexts of competition. Eventually,
						I recognised reusability as a metric, where it's equivalent to profit gained from pay-per-use
						software. Despite implicitly covering different aspects to the question that I was asked,
						such as strengths and weaknesses of reusability, I believe my answer was not structured very
						well,
						so my answer ended up being unsatisfactory. I should have finished my answer with a summary
						that explicitly returns to the question that I was asked at least, for clarity. I also
						attempted to provide an alternative metric to evaluate software, to avoid some of the
						problems associated with a single focus on reusability, but my attempt was awfully vague,
						and could do with more thought.
					</quote>
					<quote>
						Overall, I appreciate the effort that went into discussions. Reusability is no doubt,
						an important metric in many projects, and I managed to take away some things about
						it from the discussion activity. I also enjoyed thinking about it myself."

					<h3>Development</h3>
					<p>
						If I were to diffract from what i've learnt about reusability so far, I would explore
						metrics of sociobiological origin. That's because sociobiology
						doesn't necessarily reduce the concept of harm in the way
						businesses do, but it encompasses the behaviour of businesses nonetheless. In sociobiology,
						assessment generally isn't restricted to a financial assessment for the sake of a businesses success. 
						Therefore it provides a wide framework to consider the long-term harm of maximising reusability that 
						businesses (and governments) might overlook. That being said, I have no doubt that any sociobiological 
						metric would ultimately be reduced to finanical phenomena by businesses, but new metrics might inspire 
						new types of businesses.
