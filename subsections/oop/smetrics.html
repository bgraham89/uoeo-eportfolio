								<h2><u>Reusability</u></h2>
								<p>
									Reusability is desirable trait in many business models. The extent that software
									and related assets can be reusable is matter of ongoing research. The drive for
									reusability is emphasized in component-based software engineering, but it's also
									taken for granted in most programming paradigms, that make use of reuasble assets.
									Metrics for specifically measuring the reusability of software is something that 
									I'm interested in.

								</ul>
								<h3>Discussion</h3>
								<p>
									As part of a collaborative activity with my peers, we discussed <b>'which of the 11 assets 
									identified by Padhy et al (2017), should be prioritised to maximise the reusablility of 
									software?'</b>. Each of us made an initial post to answer that question, and then we responded 
									to those with our own development questions.
								</p>
								<p>
									The full discussion can be found <a href="../../assets/artefacts/oop/Reusability/Discussion.pdf" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>. 
									The following is summary of my contributions to the discussion:
								</p>
								<p>
									"In my initial post, I created a priority list for the 11 reusability properties of 
									object-oriented software given by Padhy et al., (2018), prioritised by how they 
									affect the reusability of software. I considered three different ways that software 
									can be reused; which were 1) through application to a user, 2) through code recycling 
									to a software developer, 3) through experience gained during development. 
									I prioritised properties that increased the reusability of software as an 
									application to a user, and reasoned that the ordering I provided maximised 
									the reusability of software, because there are more software users than software 
									developers, and developers are more likely to recycle code of applications that 
									are frequently reused.  
								</p>
								<p>
									I learnt from others, many different interpretations of how to prioritise 
									properties to increase the reusability of software. I had already suspected 
									that a priority list was doomed to what the language philosopher Wittgenstein (1953) 
									denotes 'language games'. That's the idea that words obtain meaning from contextual 
									rules that speakers perceive to be governed by during the activity that they 
									are participating in; so there is no singular correct answer. From reading the 
									initial posts of others, I learnt that many people believe that prioritisation 
									should take into account project specifications, and not everybody agreed that 
									all properties contributed to the reusability of software in a significant way. 
								</p>
								<p>
									During discussions I asked the following questions:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Is it possible to of make each type of asset reusable across projects?
									</li>
									<li>
										What specific steps can be taken to make different assets more reusable?
									</li>
									<li>
										Which types of assets are easiest / most difficult to document?
									</li>
									<li>
										Is it important to document the lesson's learnt from a project?
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									I asked questions because I wanted to gain some practical tips, and 
									challenge my own and others perspectives, to learn. I learned that some project 
									specifications may promote a position of disregard to the reusability of 
									some types of assets, perhaps by the project specification being too specific. 
									I learned that documentation of experiences gained during a project may have 
									some educational value, and I learned that formal documentation is a process that 
									exists as part of DevOps for some businesses.
								</p>
								<p>
									In my own discussion thread, I asked "<b>How is the reusability of software a useful metric?</b>". 
									This question ended up being reflected back at me, but that allowed me to reflect on my own position. 
									I considered reusability as software capability, and then as a motive behind software development. 
									I considered scenarios where reusability is desirable, and scenarios where it is not, 
									centring my arguments on contexts of cooperation and contexts of competition. Eventually, 
									I recognised reusability as a metric, where it's equivalent to profit gained from pay-per-use 
									software. Despite implicitly covering different aspects to the question that I was asked,
									such as strengths and weaknesses of reusability, I believe my answer was not structured very well, 
									so my answer ended up being unsatisfactory. I should have finished my answer with a summary 
									that explicitly returns to the question that I was asked at least, for clarity. I also 
									attempted to provide an alternative metric to evaluate software, to avoid some of the 
									problems associated with a single focus on reusability, but my attempt was awfully vague, 
									and could do with more thought. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Overall, I appreciate the effort that went into discussions. Reusability is no doubt, 
									an important metric in many projects, and I managed to take away some things about 
									it from the discussion activity. I also enjoyed thinking about it myself.

									If I were to diffract from this discussion, I would like to explore
									metrics of sociobiological origin. That's because sociobiology
									doesn't necessarily reduce the concept of harm in the way
									businesses do, but it encompasses 
									the behaviour of businesses nonetheless.
									Therefore it provides a wide framework to consider the long-term
									harm of maximising reusability that businesses 
									might overlook.
