					<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="#" alt="" /></span> -->
					<p>This is a collection of notes on software metrics, organised by software concerns:</p>

					<h2><u>The Software Development Life Cycle</u></h2>
					<p> The software development life cycle of a project is a central concern to a project manager.
						Metrics describing software development life cycles are either retrospective or predictive.
						Retrospective metrics are essential to project evaluation, while predictive metrics can
						influence
						process and content decisions.
					</p>
					<h3><u>Metrics</u></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Project Length</b> - The amount of days taken to progress from
							requirements analysis to deployment.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Project Throughput</b> - The reciprocal of the amount of days to complete the
							longest development stage in series of pipelined projects.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Total Working Hours</b> - The amount of hours that
							have been spent on developing a piece of software, across all workers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Time Until Deployment</b> - A predicted amount of time until a project
							can be deployed.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><u>References and Links</u></h3>
					<ul style="color:blanchedalmond">

							that outlines a goal-based project framework for software development,
							which is a framework that relies on software metrics. The textbook includes theory on
							measurment in general, types of metrics such as process, product and resource metrics; data collection
							and investigation techniques, data analysis techniques, prediction models and validation
							techniques.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>

					<h2><u>Complexity</u></h2>
					<p>
						The complexity of software corresponds to the amount of effort that's required to test it fully, which
						in turn can affect the total working hours required during the software development lifecycle. 
					</p>
					<h3><u>Metrics</u></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Coupling between Objects</b> - The total amount of edges in an object dependecy graph.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Cyclomatic Complexity</b> - The number of linearly independent paths in the software.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Depth of inheritence</b> - The distance from a class to it's top level class in an inheritence tree.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Efferent Coupling</b> - The number of classes in a package, dependent on classes outside the package.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Halstead's Vocabulary</b> - The total amount of operators and operands used in the software.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Lines of Code</b> - The total amount of lines of code in the software.

						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>

					<h2><u>Reliability</u></h2>
					<p>
						A software development lifecycle usually involves at least one stage specifically geared towards
						achieving quality and assurance, or reliability of software. Reliability contributes to a software's
						reusability as a product, and can decrease the software's future maintenence costs.
						Software testing is one way to increase software reliability. Types of testing include:
						unit testing, integration testing, performance testing and black-box testing. Some testing may
						be automatable too. Code linters for example offer a level of automated testing while code is being written, and
						software such as <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/" target="_blank">SonarQube</a> can perform
						testing while code is stored in a git repository.
					</p>
					<h3><u>Metrics</u></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Invariance Conformity</b> - The percentage of generated test cases 
							that produce results that conform to transformational invariance.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Rate of Issues</b> - The amount of recorded issues in a timespan.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: goldenrod">Resuability Metrics</b> - Some metrics related to the resuability of 
							software are directly related to a software's reliability, when software access is necessary for 
							software peformance.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: goldenrod">Security Metrics</b> - Some metrics related to the security of software
							are directly related to a software's reliability, as security bugs are a subset of software bugs.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Test Coverage</b> - The percentage of a programme that has been
							tested.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Test Effectiveness</b> - The ratio of software bugs found, to number
							of tests written.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2><u>Reusability</u></h2>
					<p>
						Software reusability can be conceptualised through the notions of assets, processess, products
						and services. Component-based software engineering is a discipline that explicitly makes use of resuable
						assets. However, all programming paradigms implicitly depend upon some reusability of entities, so
						reusability is inheritent to all software engineering too. A lot of businesses aim to produce reusable
						products or services.
					</p>
					<h3><u>Metrics</u></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Active User Count</b> - The number of concurrent users of a piece of
							software.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Availability</b> - The probability that software is available for use
							at a specific time.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: goldenrod">Reliability Metrics</b> - Some metrics related to the reliability of 
							software are directly related to a software's reusability, when the performance of software needs to
							be consistent for users.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Renewal Ratio</b> - The ratio of users who renew a software
							subscription to those that don't.
						</li>
					</ul>

					</ul>
					<h3><u>Peer Discussion</u></h3>
					<p>
						As a collaborative activity with my peers, we discussed <b style="color:powderblue">'which of
							the 11 assets identified by Padhy et al (2017), should be prioritised to maximise the reusablility of
							software?'</b>. Each of us made an initial post to answer that question, and then we
						responded to those with our own development questions. The full discussion can be found
						<a href="../../assets/artefacts/oop/discussions/Reusability.pdf" target="_blank"><b style="color:powderblue">here</b></a>.
						The following is a summary post that I wrote at the end of the discussion:
					</p>
					<quote style="color:blanchedalmond">
						"In my initial post, I created a priority list for the 11 reusability properties of
						object-oriented software given by Padhy et al., (2018), prioritised by how they
						affect the reusability of software. I considered three different ways that software
						can be reused; which were 1) through application to a user, 2) through code recycling
						to a software developer, 3) through experience gained during development.
						I prioritised properties that increased the reusability of software as an
						application to a user, and reasoned that the ordering I provided maximised
						the reusability of software, because there are more software users than software
						developers, and developers are more likely to recycle code of applications that
						are frequently reused.
					</quote>
					<quote style="color:blanchedalmond">
						I learnt from others, many different interpretations of how to prioritise
						properties to increase the reusability of software. I had already suspected
						that a priority list was doomed to what the language philosopher Wittgenstein (1953)
						denotes 'language games'. That's the idea that words obtain meaning from contextual
						rules that speakers perceive to be governed by during the activity that they
						are participating in; so there is no singular correct answer. From reading the
						initial posts of others, I learnt that many people believe that prioritisation
						should take into account project specifications, and not everybody agreed that
						all properties contributed to the reusability of software in a significant way.
					</quote>
					<quote style="color:blanchedalmond">
						During discussions I asked the following questions:
						<b style="color:blanchedalmond">Is it possible to of make each type of asset reusable across projects?</b>,
						<b style="color:blanchedalmond">What specific steps can be taken to make different assets more reusable?</b>,
						<b style="color:blanchedalmond">Which types of assets are easiest / most difficult to document?</b>, and
						<b style="color:blanchedalmond">Is it important to document the lesson's learnt from a project?</b>
					</quote>
					<quote style="color:blanchedalmond">
						I asked questions because I wanted to gain some practical tips, and
						challenge my own and others perspectives, to learn. I learned that some project
						specifications may promote a position of disregard to the reusability of
						some types of assets, perhaps by the project specification being too specific.
						I learned that documentation of experiences gained during a project may have
						some educational value, and I learned that formal documentation is a process that
						exists as part of DevOps for some businesses.
					</quote>
					<quote style="color:blanchedalmond">
						In my own discussion thread, I asked "<b style="color:blanchedalmond">How is the reusability of software a useful
							metric?</b>".
						This question ended up being reflected back at me, but that allowed me to reflect on my own
						position. I considered reusability as software capability, and then as a motive behind software
						development. I considered scenarios where reusability is desirable, and scenarios where it is not,
						centring my arguments on contexts of cooperation and contexts of competition. Eventually,
						I recognised reusability as a metric, where it's equivalent to profit gained from pay-per-use
						software. Despite implicitly covering different aspects to the question that I was asked,
						such as strengths and weaknesses of reusability, I believe my answer was not structured very
						well, so my answer ended up being unsatisfactory. I should have finished my answer with a summary
						that explicitly returns to the question that I was asked at least, for clarity. I also
						attempted to provide an alternative metric to evaluate software, to avoid some of the
						problems associated with a single focus on reusability, but my attempt was awfully vague,
						and could do with more thought.
					</quote>
					<quote style="color:blanchedalmond">
						Overall, I appreciate the effort that went into discussions. Reusability is no doubt,
						an important metric in many projects, and I managed to take away some things about
						it from the discussion activity. I also enjoyed thinking about it myself.

					<h4><u>Discusson Plenary</u></h4>
					<p>
						If I were to diffract from what i've learnt about reusability so far, I would explore
						metrics of sociobiological origin. That's because sociobiology
						doesn't necessarily reduce the concept of harm in the way
						businesses do, but it encompasses the behaviour of businesses nonetheless. In sociobiology,
						assessment generally isn't restricted to a financial assessment for the sake of a businesses
						success. Therefore it provides a wide framework to consider the long-term harm of maximising reusability
						that businesses (and governments) might overlook. I'm especially sympathetic to addicts, for which
						reusability strategies may be too effective, and therefore problematic.
					</p>
					<br>

					<h2><u>Software Quality</u></h2>
					<p>
						Software quality is a concept that is typically modelled as a composition of desirable characteristics,
						which are external qualities of the software.
					</p>
					<h3><u>Characteristics of Product Quality</u></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b style="color: lightskyblue">Compatibility</b> - Functionality in regards to clients' technology.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: lightskyblue">Maintainability</b> - Extensibility in regards to structure.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: lightskyblue">Reliability</b> - Functionality in regards to faults. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: lightskyblue">Performance</b> - Functionality in regards to resources. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: lightskyblue">Portability</b> - Extensibility in regards to clients' technology.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: lightskyblue">Security</b> - Assurance in regards to vulnerabilities.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: lightskyblue">Suitability</b> - Functionality in regards to clients' needs.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: lightskyblue">Usability</b> - Functionality in regards to clients' ability.

						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>

					<h2><u>Polymorphism</u></h2>
					<p> Polymorphism is the use of a shared procedure for different objects of different types.
						Polymorphism is possible as a result of object inheritence in all object-oriented languages, and
						is possible with duck typing too, in languages that support it.
						Metrics that measure polymorphism in a programme can indicate whether it's trivial to
						retroactively add static type checkers to programmes written in dynamic languages or not, which might be
						required in the translation of softeware from one language to another.
					</p>
					<h3><u>Metrics</u></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b style="color:gold">Polymorphic Degree</b> - The amount of different types that call a
							method during a programme.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><u>References and Links</u></h3>

							outline measures of polymorphism, such as observing and counting how many types of objects
							call each method in a programme, classifying each method by whether it's callers share a
							common superclass definition, classifying whether clusters of methods that share
							the same caller have been defined in some superclass of the cluster's callers, and
							classifying if those callers share a common subclass too.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h2 style="color: lightcoral"><u>End of Module Reflection</u></h2>
					<p>
						At the start of the course I wasn't aware of any software metrics and
						measures of quailty. I would say I was sceptical of the notion of good
						metrics and measures, as I've come from a mathematical background with
						well defined concepts. The concept of software quality characteristics,
						and good metrics looked very subjective from the surface. But during this
						module I've gained an appreciation of metrics and quality characteristics
						for the role they have in project management and scientific discourse.
						They promote progression through the objectives that they provide,
						and through the refinement of the model they operate in.
					</p>
					<p>
						The discussion I was apart of surrounding reuasability aspects of software,
						pointed me towards adopting model-based reasoning when building arguments in the future.
						During the discussion, I implictly attempted to build arguments by playing on structural 
						circumstances that provide meaning to keywords. For example; In order to answer whether 
						reusability as a business motive is good, I considered the promotion of
						reusability in the contexts of competition and cooperation seperately; because 'good' takes 
						different meaning within these different models. Similarly, I considered the 
						different ways 'software reusability' might be intepreted, and used that to build an argument
						connecting those intepretations. One reason I found my peers perspectives valuable, was for the 
						additional interpretations they provided to discussions, which is fuel for 
						intrasubjective processess such as science, and business. Software metrics and concerns
						are akin to that fuel too.
