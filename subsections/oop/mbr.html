					<p>This is a collection of notes on model-based reasoning:</p>
					<h2><u>Glossary</u></h2>
					<h3><u>Model</u></h3>
					<p>
						A model is a representation of a system. They help people
						understand, communicate, analyse, and design systems, as a simplification of
						them. Models have application to science, engineering, strategising,
						and various other domains concerned with specific systems. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In the domain of software engineering: modelling languages are used to
						model software systems, such as UML. And, software itself can have application to modelling too.
						For example; software might provide an interface for modelling, or it might
						procedurally generate models
					</p>
					<p>
						Beyond software engineering and into the domain of computer 
						science; notable types of models include data models, machine-learning models, 
						socio-techno-behavioural models, and scientific models.
					</p>
					<h3><u>Metamodels</u></h2>
					<p>
						A metamodel is the specification of a system used to 
						create modelling languages, and essentially formalises the entities 
						and relations that can be used to create modelling languages. 
						Modelling languages use the entities and relations from the metamodel,
						to provide a tool to model software with. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The additional layer of abstraction 
						that metamodels provide, is intended to produce a more rigorous foundation
						to the model-driven engineering approach of software development;
						by facilitating model validation for example. 
					</p>
					<h3><u>Ontology</u></h3>
					<p>
						An ontology is the specification of the entities and relations 
						that exist within some domain. Generally they attempt to store
						information.
					</p>
					<p>
						An ontology can be considered a type of model, but typically 
						modelling is the attempt to make explicit the details of a system,
						to further understand it and the relation to other models,
						whilst the intent of making an ontology is for cataloguing a domain.
						An example of an ontological language is OWL.
					</p>
					<h2><u>Application Software for Modelling</u></h3>
					<h3><u>Simulations</u></h3>
					<h4 style="color: palegoldenrod">Deterministic Finite State Machines (DFSMs)</h5>
					<p>
						A deterministic finite state machine is a model of any system that has a finite amount of
						states, and allows transitions between some of those states in a predictable way.
						The notion of an intitial and final states are normally specified too. DFSMs are able to describe many systems.
						For example; consider a system describing dice rolls.  A dice starts with one of it's faces up; that's one of it's six states.
						While the dice rolls, it transitions from state to state. The way it rolls is governed by it's geometry. 
						From each face, it rotates to either of the 4 faces that join with it. Eventually it ends up in a final state.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are five pieces of information
						needed to model a DFSM:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>A set of states</li>
						<li>A set of options used to evoke transitions</li>
						<li>A function that takes a state and option, and peforms the corresponding transition</li>
						<li>An initial state</li>
						<li>A set of states which may be the final states</li>
					</ol>
					<p>

					<h2><u>Peer Discussion</u></h2>
					<p>
						As a collaborative activity with my peers, we discussed <b style="color:powderblue">'What are the strengths and weaknesses of
							designing a metamodel to support object-oriented design of
							the IoT?'</b>. Each of us made an initial post to answer that question, and then we
						responded to those with our own development questions. The full discussion can be found
						<a href="../../assets/artefacts/oop/discussions/Metamodels.pdf" target="_blank"><b style="color:powderblue">here</b></a>.
						The following is a summary post that I wrote at the end of the discussion:
					</p>
					<p>
						<quote style="color:blanchedalmond">
							"In my initial post, I claimed a benefit of metamodels was that 
							they simplify domains, and a weakness was that they might eventually need to
							be replaced. At the end of the discussion, I've changed my mind on that strength.
						</quote>
						<quote style="color:blanchedalmond">
							I'm not convinced that a metamodel is necessary to facilitate 
							IoT developments. Instead, I believe an ontology would be much more 
							advantageous, as it's designed to  store information, and there 
							is a lot of different information related to IoT. The awareness of 
							ontological entities in a domain is enough for a software
							developer to get a grounding in space they are designing within. 
							Further details can be captured in an ontology too, but not necessarily 
							in a metamodel.
						</quote>
						<quote style="color:blanchedalmond">
							However a metamodel, might provide validation techniques to a 
							model, which ensures quality on some level, but I don't think the 
							validation it provides is enough to dent the complexities in IoT 
							software design, as it's the complexity of the system that's 
							difficult to overcome, not how to test the software. 
						</quote>
						<quote style="color:blanchedalmond">
							During discussions I asked the following questions:
							<b style="color:blanchedalmond">Is there any reason that UML must be replaced for IoT software modelling?</b>,
							<b style="color:blanchedalmond">Is it worth having a new metamodel, and new modelling language devoted to IoT?</b>, and
							<b style="color:blanchedalmond">Is there some way to speed up the research and adoption of a good enough metamodel for IoT?</b>
						</quote>

					<h3><u>Discusson Plenary</u></h3>
					<p>
						I think this discussion was a little bit more rushed than the previous discussion, which is a shame as it
						was evolving into something more interesting than when it started. The rush I believe, was due to the overlap of
						this activity with the assessed parts of the module. I would say the main take away for me from this discussion was
						the void it created that I ended up trying to fill in afterwards. In this discussion I feel like I went from not
						quite understanding what a metamodel was, to being confident at explaining what a metamodel is and it's relation to
						similar concepts.
