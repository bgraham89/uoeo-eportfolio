					<h2><u>Use Case Diagrams</u></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A use case is a functional requirement that an information system is expected to meet.</li>
						<li>A use case can be associated with particular categories of users, or actors.</li>
						<li>Relationships may exist between use cases such as generalizations, inclusions and
							extensions.</li>
						<li>Relationships among cases and actors can be modelled using a use case diagram.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Example</h3>
					<p style="
										text-align: center;
										">
						An example of a use case diagram for an autonomous car.

					<h3>Review</h3>
					<p>
						I don't really like use case diagrams, despite their
						acceptance into UML for the following reasons:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The informality of them makes them redundant to technical modelling.
						</li>
						<li>
							The structure that they are confined to restricts their potential as an infographic.
						</li>
						<li>
							I could have chosen multiple different viable sets of imperative phrases
							that accurately label expected responses, and resulted in different versions
							of the diagram above. So consistency is ignored.
							That being said, an ensemble attempt of building a use case
							diagram might resolve any interpersonal ambiguities. The construction
							process may more important than the result.
						</li>
						<li>
							An actor may be involved in many use cases, resulting in either visual clutter,
							or the absence of lines where there should be.
						</li>
						<li>
							The extension-relationship between use cases is a baroque way to say
							"sometimes do this", and doesn't provide rigor to the model beyond that
							of a checklist. Other diagrams capture this information more completely.
						</li>
						<li>
							Relationships between actors and use cases are ambigious. For example;
							the relationship between a 'passenger' and a 'establish route' use case,
							in the example above, is two fold. The passenger may choose to drive themself,
							and establish a route with the aid of a satnav built into the car,
							or the passenger may request the car to establish a route to drive itself.
							The diagram lacks the notion of interfaces, which is essential to modelling
							the requirements of a system relative to actors.
						</li>
						<li>
							Details of the relationships between use cases are more accessible when using
							other types of diagram which offer more detail. Details of the relationships between actors
							and use cases
							are not included in use case diagrams, making a use case diagram little more use
							than a list of actors and expectations. Perhaps that is the point. But then
							why doesn't a checklist suffice?
						</li>
						<li>
							The diagrams are too rigid for developmental value.
							Use cases and systems are treated different
							conceptually, and the relationships beween actors and use cases are
							fundamentally different to the relationships between use cases too.
							This seems limiting in a bad way.
							I'd like to explore the abstraction of use case diagrams to gain
							some of the properties that circuit diagrams have.
							It would be interesting to be able to combine use case diagrams in a modular way,
							by using actors/interfaces as anchor points. It would
							also be interesting to be able to deconstruct use cases, into more granular use case
							diagrams,
							using use case interfaces as actors. Overall, I believe this would create more value
							of the architecture that use case diagrams provide, especially in an incremental software
							development lifecycle, where streamlining the transition between analysis and design is
							valuable.
						</li>
						<li>
							The value of a use case diagrams has largely been narrowed to depicting business use cases,
							and relevant actors, so internal relationships between use cases are little more than
							decoration,
							and potentially a distraction. There are much cooler diagrams to impress stakeholders
							with irrelavnt details.
						</li>

					<h2><u>Pen Portraits</u></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Users are an essential requirement for the success of software.</li>
						<li>Groups of users are clustered together when shared descriptions have predictive value.</li>
						<li>A pen portrait is an informal description of a person or group of people.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Example</h3>
					<p style="
										text-align: center;
										">
						An example of a pen portrait for the users of autonomous car.

					<h2><u>Activity Diagrams</u></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Activity states are chunks of computation.</li>
						<li>An activity diagram is a model of the flow between Activity states of an information system.
						</li>
						<li>An activity diagram can include conditional branching, concurrent branching and
							computational swimlanes.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Example</h3>
					<p style="
										text-align: center;
										">
						An example of an activity diagram a autonomous car.
