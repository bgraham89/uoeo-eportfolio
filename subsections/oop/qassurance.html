					<h3>Glossary</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b style="color: palegreen">Debuggers</b> - Software that allows breakpointing, 
							or pausing during code execution. 
							Debuggers help with getting information such as variable states, or the function call 
							stack when needed. These could be right before an error occurs for example.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: palegreen">Linters</b> - Software that inspects the syntax 
							and static semantics of a programme, before it's execution.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: palegreen">Loggers</b> - Software that allows the recording
							of details during code execution. This is usually done by writing comments to a file,
							dependent on in-code prompts.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b style="color: palegreen">Testing Suites</b> - Software that asserts conditions
							on a programme during execution and monitors compliance to those conditions.
						</li>

					<h2><u>Python Utilities</u></h2>
					<h3>Guard Functions</h3>
					<p>
						During my implementation of an autonomous car system, part of this modules' coursework, I made use of a helper function
						for explicitly asserting guard conditions on function paramaters. This was done to make the code more readable.
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/oop/snippets/screenshots/arg_guard.png" alt="arg function"/>
					<p>
						If a guard condition is not met, the function raises an <code>AssertionError</code>. If the shape of the params doesn't
						match the guard condition, then the function raises a <code>TypeError</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The guard conditions were defined in the relevant classes themselves, mainly for accessiblity reasons. 
						They consisted of nested functions for readability, and took the form of lambda functions.
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/oop/snippets/screenshots/arg_constraint.png" alt="arg constraint"/>
					<p>
						The constraints could then be added to any method as needed.

					<p>
						During this course I have gained a deeper understanding of some of the theory
						behind software quality tools, such as Abstract Syntax Tree model of languages,
						and measures of complexity.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've actively been trying to utilise ideas that I've picked up to try and improve
						my workplace. I've begun to build a script for converting a typescript framework into
						Class diagrams, by interacting with the AST of the framework files. 
						The motivation behind this is purely educational, to improve the documentation
						of the complex framework we use at work for newcomers.
					</p>
					<p>
						I believe the biggest takeaway for me though from this section of the course, is 
						learning about object mixins. They allow for the seperation of quality concerns from 
						core functionality in a OOP system, which can otherwise make core functionality
						less readable. According to the creator of python, we spend most our time reading code,
						so this should increase my productivity in a notable way.
