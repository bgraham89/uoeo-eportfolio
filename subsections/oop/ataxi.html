						The topic of autonomous vehicles was a reoccuring theme throughout this module, and we were asked to design and implement
						a system that would provide three core functionalities to an autonomous vehicle. My submissions can be found:
						<a href="https://github.com/bgraham89/uoeo-eportfolio/tree/main/assets/artefacts/oop/tasks" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>
					</p>
					<h2><u>Design</u></h2>
					<p>
						The design consisted of five UML diagrams, three of which are included below that outline the three core 
						functionalities of the system:

					<h2><u>Implementation</u></h2>
					<p>
						The implementation was in Python. Some of main features I'd like to mention are: the use of
						abstract base classes, the use of reasonable datastructures and algorithms, the simple main-script 
						template, the organised file structure and the use of a testing framework. Examples of this are 
						showcased below:

					<h2 style="color: lightcoral"><u>End of Module Reflection</u></h2>
					<p>
						At the start of this module, I knew nothing about the software of autonomous cars. It's not the easiest
						domain to jump into and begin designing for, hence companies are spending much more time building
						autonomous vehicles, so it's definitely a daunting task. But I was able to identify foundational models
						in domain to build upon, and start designing a system from those. Those key models included the 
						sense-plan-act architecture of robotics, and the network data transmission model. Then I was able 
						to consider how the internal components would interact, and how the car would interact with the 
						technological environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						The design phase was challenging because I had to chose three different core functionalities to implement.
						I was proud of my UML diagrams as I took the time build details with reference to actual research, in a short
						timeframe. My feedback was good, so I believe I successfully communicated my ideas. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						The implementation phase was much more interesting for me. I spent a large amount of time building the software from
						scratch including datastructures, abstract base classes, test cases, network components, network protocols,
						information models and a tolerable text-based front end. I was able to implement the core functionalities 
						that I had planned to. So I'm proud of what I did. The only thing I could have realistically improved with the 
						resources
						that I had, was the documentation and comments, which I noticed contained some spelling mistakes afterwards.
					</p>
					<p>
						There were many ways this project can be improved, such as by utilising asychronous functions. Most of the
						programme was encapsulated in objects, but some parts wasn't such as the helper functions. I could have
						placed those helper functions in a mixin object, for the sake of OOP, but I think that encapsulating them
						in a module was good enough, for any practical purpose. Other things that could have been improved included
						the range of components available to the car, the capabilities of the car, the documentation,
						I could have used powerful external libraries and SaaS services, built a GUI, or VUI. I think the next thing
						to do from this project, is to try and build a microgame with a better GUI, and explore a library
						such as tensorflow or pytorch, to build a neural network for the car to use.
