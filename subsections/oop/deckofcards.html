						<h1>Deck of Cards</h1>
					</header>
					<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="#" alt="" /></span> -->
					<p>This is an implementation of a deck of cards using the OOP paradigm. The purpose of this
						implementation is to showcase
						some of the features of object-oriented programming that make it great. The other purpose is to
						provide a snapshot of my familiarity with OOP and Python at the beginning of this module.
					</p>
					<h2><u>Card Class</u></h2>
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/oop/snippets/screenshots/card.png" alt="code example of card class" data-position="center center" />
					<p>
						The<code>Card</code>class above has two private attributes and two public attributes.
						<b>Private attributes</b> are attributes not intended for access from outside an instance.
						<b>Public attributes</b> are attributes that are free to be accessed from ouside an instance.
					</p>
					<h2><u>Deck Class</u></h2>
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/oop/snippets/screenshots/deck.png" alt="code example of deck class" data-position="center center" />
					<p>
						The<code>Deck</code>class above inherits from the list class.
						<b>Inheritence</b> is a feature of OOP, which allows the adoption of attributes and
						methods from one class to another. By inheriting from the list class, instances
						of the <code>Deck</code> class may be passed as an argument to the <code>len()</code> function,
						or followed by the <code>.sort()</code> list method; for example.
					</p>
					<h2><u>IntegerCard Class</u></h2>
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/oop/snippets/screenshots/integercard.png" alt="code example of integercard class" data-position="center center" />
					<p>
						The<code>IntegerCard</code>class above inherits from the <code>Card</code> class
						and further abstracts the features of a physical card.
						<b>Abstraction</b> is the manipulation of the details of a concept to arrive at
						a more general concept, and is a general technique of OOP. Usually abstraction
						refers to the creation of abstract classes, which are classes that provide an 
						interface for other classes to implement.
						But in the above example, the <code>IntegerCard</code> is not an abstract class.
						It's an abstraction in the sense that the details of a physical card have been
						encoded to a non-human readable format in preparation for an implementation of a 
						quick hand-ranking algorithm.
					</p>
					<h2><u>PokerHand Class</u></h2>
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/oop/snippets/screenshots/pokerhand.png" alt="code example of pokerhand class" data-position="center center" />
					<p>
						The<code>PokerHand</code>class above encapsulates details connected to a physical poker hand,
						although it is not yet complete.
						<b>Encapsulation</b> is the provision of a clear boundary to something. The objects of
						OOP naturally encapsulate information in the form of attributes and methods. A good name for a
						class clarifies
						it's purpose, for example it's clear that the <code>PokerHand</code> class represents a
						physical poker hand. That doesn't mean classes need to mimic physical objects though. It's also
						common
						to name classes after <b>design patterns</b>, which are abstractions of structure that is unique
						to OOP.
					</p>
					<p>
						The last thing I'd like to point out is that it's usually
						good practise to maintain common interfaces for your classes where possible.
						This can simplify programmes to a large degree, by allowing a single procedure to be enough
						for a bunch of different objects, which share the same interface. This idea is known as 
						<b>polymorphism</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you would like to learn more about implementing a game of five card draw poker using OOP,
						check out
						my old <a href="https://github.com/bgraham89/fivecarddraw" target="_blank"><b>home

					<h2 style="color: lightcoral"><u>End of Module Reflection</u></h2>
					<p>
						At the start of this module, I had some familiarity with Python and OOP already. The extent of 
						ability was marked by this section, and the linked poker-engine project I'd worked on previously. But 
						I had no previous explicit experience with design patterns or modelling languages. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Now that I'm at the end of this module, I wish 
						I could go back to my old poker project and upgrade it's overall design. During this module, I've learnt some 
						design patterns and python tricks that would be actually useful in that project. For example, In my old 
						implementation, I never thought to encapsulate player actions; but if I had used the command design pattern, 
						it would have simplified the action tracking algorithm that I frankensteined together, and allowed undoing
						actions when handling errors. During the course, 
						I learnt some Python tricks too, such as using the classmethod decorator to constrain or diversify object 
						initialisations, which could be used to limit a deck to 52 unique cards in theory. I've gained an 
						appreciation of modelling languages too, which helped me reflect on my old poker project, and simplify it's design. 
					</p>
					<p> 
						I recognise the benefits of learning object-oriented programming, are not just for my
						poker project, but extend in to the professional world of software engineering, where
						I currently work as part of a team. On some level, OOP, design patterns and modelling languages 
						communicative tools for developing ideas as part of research, and on another level they are a set
						of tried and tested standards underpinning many successful projects. Their popularity and effectiveness
						makes these topics vital to any software engineer expecting to work with others. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The next step for me professionally I think is to learn another language, such as c++, which is a 
						valuable tool in the software engineering for its speed. That being said, c# might be a good canditate
						too. Both langauges are connected to game engines, that I could learn as a hobby alongside my current job.
						I currently work as a game developer, mainly using typescript, so those languages would compliment my cv.
						I'm especially interested in making games that incorporate ai models, to gain some experience in that field too.
