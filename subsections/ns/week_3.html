						<h1>Week 3</h1>
                    </header>
					<h2>Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Baseline Analysis and Plan</h2>
					<p>
						This week I spent time creating a baseline analysis and vulnerability assessment proposition for a website. I found
						this task valuable for practise, and providing the opportunity to pull knowledge and present it in a professional way. The
						reason for that is as follows.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout the masters course so far, outside of the domain specific content, I had been focusing
						particularly on critical writing and research skills, building up a model-centric view of general processes,
						placing models at the heart of learning, communicating, coordinating, and developing strategically. This meant I had been 
						focused on discovering and criticising models from the viewpoint of a scientist. My efforts in this module have changed though
						due to a ephiphany I had during my last module. One of my group members took our critically-sound presentation 
						and modified it to appear much more corporate, without losing academic credibility. I was really impressed by the results. 
						I had the epiphany that I could focus on my professional and corporate character development, without sacrificing my 
						deep appreciation of science for sciences sake. I could direct my attention towards details that other people 
						think matter in the name of professionalism, instead of details that I was personally interested in; with hope that one day 
						I would be able to then afford to learn what I want to learn and actually make improvements to areas I care about. 
						I think this is important for my future self to remember. I began learning computer science in the first place because I
						saw the scalablility of technology as a tool for dealing with problems efficiently. The blockers of that vision are the problems
						I care about. So in my baseline analysis and vulnerability assessment proposition, I did my best to make the presentation
						as professional as possible, including organisational features such as a cover page, contents and footnotes. 
						Presentation is a skill tht I would like to continue developing.
					</p>
					<p>
						My baseline analysis and plan are available 
						<a href="https://github.com/bgraham89/uoeo-eportfolio/tree/main/assets/artefacts/ns/pdf/" traget="_blank">here</a>.
					</p>
					<h2>TCP/IP Technical Overview</h2>
					<p>
						This week I also spent time reading Parziale et al's 2006 webbook: 
						<a href="https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/gg243376.html?Open" target="_blank">TCP/IP Tutorial and Technical Overview</a>.
						The book talks about the history and the various layers of the TCP/IP protocol stack, covering a range of protocols and 
						technologies at each layer. I found this book to be very difficult to digest in one reading as it includes 
						many protocol header structures that would require dedicated time to memorise. I would like to try and implement network protocols,
						at a pace of one layer per week, to help consolidate the information in this book, as a low level recollection of network protocols
						is fundamental to network security and engineering professions. I think having a weekly microproject is an excellent way to learn
						alongside our careers, so this is on my to do list once my course has finished. For now, I'm happy to be spending time on 
						organisational skills and network diagnostic tools, that serve a direct, practical purpose for myself. 
					</p>
					<h2>Network Diagnostics</h2>
					<p>
						There are many scanning tools and guides available on the internet to begin learning about your own, or remote networks.
						This week I traced network packets to the website that I proposed a vulnerability audit and assessment for and peformed a WHOIS
						search for it to identify information such as the registered contact, the mx record, the hosting platform and the main nameservers.
						The results of this alongside further network diagnostics will be presented in week 6 as part of the vulnerability audit and
						asssessment.
